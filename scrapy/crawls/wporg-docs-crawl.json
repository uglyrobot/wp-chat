{"text": "\nSecuring your WordPress starts with a strong password. A strong password is complex and elaborate. It isn’t easy to guess since it doesn’t contain recognizable words, names, dates or numbers. While I wouldn’t suggest picking a password containing less than 20 characters, I can certainly understand it can be hard to remember a random string of letters, numbers and special characters. But in general, the more characters and complexity, the better.\nSo I would suggest you uphold following guidelines when creating a strong password:\nAt least 20 characters (preferrably more)Use lowercase and uppercaseContaining numbersContaining special characters such as a question or an exclamation mark\nExampleA good password that upholds all of the guidelines above could be “As32!KoP43??@ZkI??L0d”.\nThings You Should Absolutely Avoid\nNames or words that can be easily linked to you:\nThe name of your partner or kidsThe name of your petThe name of your companyThe name of your favorite sports-team or car brandThe year in which you were bornYour birthday\nAll these items are personal (mostly public) information and thus possible risks for social engineering. So avoid these at all cost!\nExample\nIf you’re name is John Rogers and you were born in 1976, “JohnRogers1976” would be a really bad idea for a password.\nGeneric password elements:\nNumber sequences like “123” or “54321”Using generic words like “admin”, “administrator”, “pass”, “password”, “blue”, “house”…\nThese kind of elements are the first terms that are tried by hackers when attempting to brute force your password, so please avoid these too.\nExampleObviously, the password examples below are horrible passwords and NOT SECURE:\nMattMullenweg2018admin123\nYou should also avoid using the same password on multiple sites or accounts.\nKeeping track of your passwords\nSince complex passwords are a real necessity these days, it can be a real burden to remember every single password. And thus most people resort to using a password manager to keep track of their different passwords. These password managers actually become a vault for your passwords, secured by one complex master password. They also have functions to automatically (or on your command) enter the stored password for you. This way you only need to remember your one master password to access the password manager vault.\nPopular password managers\n1PasswordDashlaneKeePassLastPassRoboform\nMost password managers are a paid service, however if you’re looking for a free solution, you’d might want to check out KeePass.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/password-best-practices/", "title": "Password Best Practices – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Securing your WordPress starts with a strong password.

{"text": "\nThank you for contributing to the project we all love! Your participation is vital to the WordPress project.\nWordPress is a user-driven project, and all developments and enhancements depend on users like you! Please consider contributing to the project and the WordPress Community in one or more of the ways outlined below. Contributions from users like you keep the project vibrant, alive, and on the path of progress.\nWhether you’re a budding developer, a pixel-perfect designer, or just like helping out, we’re always looking for people to help make WordPress even better. Below is an overview of ways to get involved and help out. If you want to dive right in, visit https://make.wordpress.org/.\nDocumentation\nAll of the WordPress user and developer documentation has been produced by users like you and me! The many different ways in which you can volunteer your time and effort to improve the quality and scope of documentation are outlined in Documentation Contributor Handbook.\nThe slack channel #docs is the forum for discussing all issues related to documentation.\nTranslation\nTranslating WordPress describes the process of translating the WordPress software, so that people can use WordPress for blogs in languages other than English. This article tells you how to find and join the teams that are translating WordPress.\nThe slack channel #polyglots is for questions, suggestions and discussions related to translating WordPress; please feel free to join in.\nTo get involved with the Translation team, please review https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/.\nWordPress Support Forum\nAnother valuable contribution you can make is donating some of your time to help other users of WordPress. All WordPress related support at the WordPress Support Forum is provided free of cost, and the involvement of users is essential to maintain this.\nIf you’d like to help, read visit https://make.wordpress.org/support/ for more information.\nWordPress Chat on Slack\nSlack has replaced IRC as a way to organize and get work done on WordPress. The community is vibrant, responsive, and very active. Please join us on our Slack channel and start getting involved today.\nThere is a weekly meetup of core developers in #core on Slack. Agendas, minutes, and discussion between meetups all take place on the WordPress Development Blog.\nWhile the IRC Live chat is still active, our Slack Channel is where we are getting work done. Please join us on http://chat.wordpress.org\nWordPress Development\nYou can help with the development of the WordPress software, whether or not you are a software developer.\nDevelopment Planning\nOne way to participate in WordPress development is to suggest features and participate in the development planning process. Even if you aren’t a developer, you can help build consensus and formalize proposals, boiling down long email threads and IRC logs to their essence, so that developers can quickly ascertain what the community is hoping to achieve with a particular feature.\nTesting WordPress\nAnother valuable contribution a non-developer (or developer) can make to WordPress development is to test WordPress. Before every stable release of WordPress, pre-release versions are made to enable testing. You can download the pre-releases and test them, so that the WordPress developers can fix problems before the new version is made available to the public. If you would like to get involved in this effort, join the wp-testers mailing list, where new releases are announced and discussed.\nIf you want to be on the bleeding edge of development, even before pre-release versions are put together, you can also check out the latest software from the WordPress Subversion (SVN) repository, as outlined in Using Subversion. Or, you can get the “nightly build” (which is created from the Subversion repository, and available as a zip file) at https://wordpress.org/nightly-builds/wordpress-latest.zip — almost as up-to-date as the instantaneous Subversion repository.\nIf you find bugs while testing pre-release or already-released versions of WordPress, see the section just below.\nReporting Bugs\nAnother way you can contribute to WordPress development is by reporting any problems you find with the WordPress software. The process of reporting bugs is described in Reporting Bugs — please start by reading that article. Once you have understood the bug reporting process, you can search the WordPress Trac database to see if your issue has already been reported, and if not, file a new report. Your help with reporting bugs will be highly appreciated.\nFixing Bugs and Other Programming\nIf you are a software developer, you can also help the development of WordPress by fixing problems that have been reported by you or another person in the WordPress Trac database. This process is also known as “patching”, and is described in Reporting Bugs. That article also has some suggestions on how to find bugs to fix.\nYou can also subscribe to the wp-hackers mailing list to participate in discussions regarding WordPress development. All contributions, ideas and suggestions are welcome at the mailing list. Sometimes, requests are also made on the list asking for the help of volunteers to assist in the improvement and development of specific functionality.\nIf you are not familiar with the patching process or how to use Subversion, we recommend OpenHatch Training Missions as an easy learning tool.\nOccasionally there are also bug scrubs in the #core Slack channel. They are usually announced ahead of time on the make/core blog, and more details about what a bug scrub involves is available in the core team handbook.\nYou may also be interested to read this page on How does code make it into WordPress. It details how bug fixes, code and new features are included into the next releases of WordPress.\nShow You Care\nIf you enjoy WordPress or find it to be useful, put a link to WordPress on your site. You can do this with a text link, or use one of the many WordPress logos on your site with a link to http://wordpress.org. Show you care.\nDonating Money\nThe WordPress Community exists because everyone takes part in some way, by giving their time, energy, and sometimes even money, because they believe in the valuable services WordPress provides. We invite you to join the community in whatever way you feel is appropriate, and donating money to WordPress Theme and Plugin authors and developers who give so freely of their creativity and expertise by offering their services for free to all WordPress users is a good place to start.\nIf you use a WordPress Theme or Plugin and your WordPress blog depends upon it, contact the author and find out how you can give back and support their continued efforts. It takes a lot of time and energy to create and then support Themes and Plugins, keeping them updated as WordPress changes and bugs are found. Many take donations or appreciate it when you blog about their Plugin or Theme. Others offer their Plugins and Themes as experiential portfolios– you play with it, you like it, you hire them. Most clearly indicate how they appreciate compensation for their hard work – give back to WordPress by giving back to them.\nThe more the WordPress Community supports the programmers, developers, testers, and challengers, the stronger and better WordPress becomes. Sometimes that means donating money, sometimes it means saying thank you.\nJust remember, every contribution counts, no matter what it looks like. It takes every one of us to make WordPress better.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/become-a-wordpress-contributor/", "title": "Become a WordPress contributor – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Thank you for contributing to the project we all love!

{"text": "\nAfter you make a few changes in your WordPress content or your design, you may notice that nothing has changed.\nA number of common factors can cause this behavior, such as: browser caching, server-side caching, caching plugins, and making changes in the incorrect location in the file system.\nThe Browser Cache\nSometimes when you first visit a web page, it takes a while to load. But then the next page you visit within that site doesn’t take quite so long. This is because – in an effort to be helpful – your web browser stores the web page information on your computer. In the future, the web browser reloads the web page data from your computer, not from the actual site. The place where this web page data is stored is called the cache. The cache is an essential way to optimize your web browsing experience.\nSometimes a problem can arise when you make a small change to your site, and the browser doesn’t recognize it as a significant change. Since the browser hasn’t registered your adjustment as an actual change, it opts to reload the exact same page that you previously looked at. The solution in this case is to clear or empty your browser’s cache.\nClearing the Browser Cache\nNormally, to see the changes on your page, you click the Refresh button on the browser toolbar or press the F5 key on your keyboard. In many cases, this simply reloads the page without clearing the browser’s cache. Here are some techniques to wipe clean the browser’s cache, so that you will see the changes when your page reloads.\nThe way you clear the browser cache depends on the particular browser you are using. Here is how you clear the cache on a few common browsers:\nChrome – How to delete your Chrome cache, history, and other browser dataSafari – Clear your browsing history in Safari on MacFirefox – How to clear the Firefox cacheInternet Explorer – How to delete the contents of the Temporary Internet Files folderMicrosoft Edge – View and delete browser history in Microsoft EdgeOpera – How to clear the Opera cache\nIn addition to clearing the cache, each browser may have a way of stopping or minimizing the caching of web pages. Using this technique will definitely slow down your web page viewing, and it isn’t a perfect solution, because some caching may still occur. However, in a small way it does still help. Check your internet browser’s help files for specifics on how to turn off the cache feature.\nServer-side Caching\nBe aware that some web hosting services use caching plugins on the backend without letting the user know explicitly. You may be able to turn this off via your webhost’s configuration panel. Just to be sure, you can ask a webhost support member if any caching plugins are used, and request to have them turned off if needed.\nThis situation may also occur if you are using a managed WordPress hosting plan. Many managed WordPress hosting plans use server-side caching. If you are using a managed WordPress service from your hosting provider and you are seeing this issue, you may want to see if they have an option to manually flush the cache. In many cases, your changes will immediately show up after flushing the cache.\nIf you are using a caching HTTP reverse proxy such as Varnish on your web server, edits to your files may not appear right away. Edits may become visible after some length of time when the cached version expires. You many need to tune your caching system in order to eliminate this issue.\nA WordPress Cache Plugin\nSome WordPress plugins also add cache functionality to your WordPress site. This helps your site load faster, because WordPress can retrieve the pages of your blog from the cache instead of generating them all over again.\nAny good cache plugin will clear the cache when a post, page, or comment is published. However, if you make other changes (e.g. to your theme), the cache may not be cleared and the old version will still appear. In this case, check the plugin’s instructions to find out how to clear its cache.\nNote that WordPress does not come with a cache by default, so the above would only apply if you installed a cache plugin yourself.\nCheck Your Source\nSometimes even the very best web page designers, developers, and programmers make a mistake. It’s the little details that can mess things up. Let’s look at some of the most commonly overlooked details that happen when you aren’t paying attention.\nCheck the Address\nIs the name and folder for the file you “fixed” the same as the one you are viewing? Look at the following two addresses (URLs).\nwordpress/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/style.csstest/wordpress/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/style.css\nIn this case, you can probably see the difference, but when viewed in an address bar or in a text editor, you might miss the word test that specifies a specific folder location.\nPay very close attention to the difference between style1.css and stylel.css if you are using different style names, too. The first filename is style followed by the digit one, while the second filename is style followed by a lowercase L. If you are working with different but similar files, make sure you give them distinctive names like style-red.css and style-800.css so you can clearly see the difference.\nCheck the Template\nIf you’re editing a template, are you sure that the page you’re viewing is being generated from that template? Remember that many templates contain very similar text. For example, a post header may appear on a single post page, an index page, a search page, or an archive page, to name a few.\nSee Template Hierarchy if you’re having trouble figuring out which template is in use.\nCheck Your Upload\nWhen you make a change to a file, it is often on your computer’s hard drive, and you have to upload the file to your host server in order to view it on the internet. Did you actually upload it? Did you put it in the right folder? Is it really there? When overwriting the exact same file, it doesn’t always do a complete overwrite, so consider deleting the original from the host server and then uploading a new version, to make sure that the correct file is there in its entirety.\nTest Yourself\nLet’s say that: a) You’re working with the correct file, and b) It’s in the right place with the right name, but you still can’t see the changes you’ve made.\nAt this point, it’s time to complete the following steps:\nMake a backup of the file you are working on and check that the backup is in a safe place.Make a big change (such as setting the background in your style.css as #ff0000 or even red).View the changed web page in your browser. Make sure you clear the cache, to be sure you have the new version.If nothing changes, delete the file (and only that file) from the server and try to view the file again. If nothing continues to change, you and WordPress are looking at completely different files. It’s time to get out your detective hat and start figuring out what is happening and where your files went.Check your URL settings in your options panel and also in the database. If this issue still continues to be unsolvable, make a post about it on the WordPress Forum, and let the experts step in to help.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-i-make-changes-and-nothing-happens/", "title": "FAQ I Make Changes and Nothing Happens – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "After you make a few changes in your WordPress content or your design, you may notice that nothing has changed.

{"text": "\nWordPress houses lots of different types of content and they are divided into something called Post Types﻿. A single item is called a post however this is also the name of a standard post type called posts. By default WordPress comes with a few different post types which are all stored in the database under the wp_posts table.\nDefault Post Types\nThe default post types that are always included within a WordPress installation unless otherwise removed are:\nPostsPagesAttachmentsRevisionsNavigation MenusCustom CSSChangesets\nPosts\nA post in WordPress is a post type that is typical for, and most used by blogs. Posts are normally displayed in a blog in reverse sequential order by time (newest posts first). Posts are also used for creating RSS feeds.\nPages\nA page is similar to posts however they have some very important differences. Pages aren’t displayed in a reversed time-based order. They can also be placed into a hierarchical order where a page can be the parent or child of another page creating a page structure. Traditionally, pages also do not make use of categories and tags like posts do.\nAttachments\nAttachments are another post type that is special as these hold information about any media that is uploaded to your WordPress website. Not only is the main post information stored where other posts are, attachments also make use of the wp_postmeta table for storing extra information like metadata for images and videos that you’ve added.\nRevisions\nRevisions are a particularly special post type as they are used to create a history of other post types in case you make a mistake and want to rollback to a previous version. Whilst you technically can’t edit revisions directly unless you restore a revision, they are editable just like posts and are stored in the wp_posts table like any other post type.\nMenus\nMenus in WordPress are lists of links that can be used to navigate your website. This allows you to create custom lists of links to various locations on your website that is used by your visitors and are edited in the theme section of the dashboard away from traditional post types like posts or pages.\nCustom CSS\nCustom CSS﻿ is a theme specific post type used to store CSS saved from The Customizers Additional CSS screen. Each theme can have its own custom CSS post but only the active themes `custom_css` post is actually used.\nChangesets\nChangesets are similar to revisions but specifically for the Customizer. This is to keep the Customizer in a persistent state. WordPress will attempt to keep content changes made through the Customizer during the user session in a `customize_changeset` post and attempt to restore them should you exit your current session.\nCustom Post Types\nWhilst there are already lots of standard post types within WordPress, you may want to extend the amount of post types you have if you want to break things down into smaller categories. For example, if you want to have a section on Books, it would be better suited to creating a custom post type for them. This can be done using the register_post_type function.\nIt’s highly recommended that you define custom post types within a plugin or must-use plugin to ensure that if you switch themes, the post type isn’t lost. That way you can ensure your content is always accessible.\nTemplate Files\nBy default WordPress makes use of the index.php, single.php and archive.php files in a theme to display posts of any type of the front-end of a website. However, if you’ve made a custom post type, you may find that you want to show this information in a different way to other types. You can do this by using post type specific custom templates within your theme.\nIf you create a post type called Books like in the example above, you can create a template file called single-books.php which will show the individual book posts that you publish. Again, to show all your books in a custom archive page (where they are all listed), you can create an archive-books.php template file and this will show all the book posts that you’ve published.\nPost Type Queries\nIn the event that you want to get a list of your custom posts called Books, you can create a new WP_Query instance and fetch them all. This is handy if you want to create a custom loop somewhere on your website and show them in a different way to other posts.\nThe Posts Query\nYou might find that in some cases you want to include custom posts into your main query of blog posts. You can do this by using the pre_get_posts filter hook which lets you customize the query that gets your posts before it’s shown on the front-end of the website.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-is-post-type/", "title": "What is Post Type? – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "WordPress houses lots of different types of content and they are divided into something called Post Types﻿.

{"text": "\nUsers →︎ Your Profile\nThe Your Profile Screen is accessible from both the main navigation menu under Users and by clicking on your name link at the top of the WordPress screen. Here you can specify your name and how it will be displayed on your site, your e-mail address (for administrative purposes), other personal information, and personal options.\nYour Profile Screen\nYour Profile and Personal Options\nThe only pieces of information WordPress requires you to include in your Profile are your e-mail address and a nickname. It should be noted that WordPress requires your email address only for your blog’s administration purposes. The email address is never sent to any other site (not even to the people at WordPress headquarters), and it is never displayed on your site (unless you put it there manually). Only the other registered users of your blog have access to the e-mail address you provide. Also, remember that each user’s email address must be unique.\nNote: it is possible for a theme to display your e-mail address (and the e-mail addresses of your other registered users) on your site, since the the_author_meta('user_email') template tag can be used for such purposes. This would be a poorly conceived theme, however, if it didn’t inform you of that before you downloaded it. None of the themes included with WordPress display any e-mail address anywhere on the public side of your site by default.\nAll of the other personal information asked for here is optional, and, again, it is never sent to any other site or person. It may be displayed on your site, however, depending on the theme you use, so you should test things out with your particular theme if you’re at all paranoid (and a bit of paranoia regarding your personal information is healthy). See the_author and related template tags for information on how to display this information on your site (and, consequently, how to ensure the theme you use does/does not display any of this information). Typically, themes only display the information you enter in the Display name publicly as field, however the Authors username is also often included in the URL (for Author Archives) and in the CSS classes for per-author targeted stylings.\nPersonal Options :\nVisual Editor – Checking this box Disables the visual editor when writing, and uses the plain HTML editor.Syntax Highlighting – Checking this box Disable syntax highlighting when editing code.Admin Color Scheme – Check this radio button next to the color scheme desired for the Administration Screens. The left two colors are menu background colors and the right two are roll-over colors.\nColor scheme of Administration Screens\nKeyboard Shortcuts – Checking this box Enables keyboard shortcuts for comment moderation. Keyboard shortcuts are designed to allow you to rapidly navigate and perform actions on comments. The Keyboard Shortcuts article describes the various shortcuts in detail.Toolbar – Check the box to display the Toolbar when you are viewing your site.Language – You can select the language you wish to use while using the Administration Screen without affecting the language site visitors see.\nName :\nUsername – You cannot edit your Username because it is used as your Username during the login process. Even an Administrator cannot change your Username. Usually, no one else ever needs to see your Username.First name – Enter your first name in this text box.Last name – Enter your last name in this text box.Nickname – Enter the nickname as it is a required for every user. It may be the same as your User Name or it can be different. If you don’t supply a Nickname, then the User Name will be placed in this field.Display name publicly as – Select, from the drop-down, how your name is cited on your blog. This defaults to your first and last name. You can choose from several of the above pieces of information: Nickname, Login name, First Name, Last Name, “First Last“, or “Last First“. If you prefer “Last, First“, insert a comma after your last name in the Last Name text box above and choose the last option from this dropdown.\nContact Info :\nE-mail – All users are required to list an e-mail address in their respective Profiles. The E-mail address must be unique for each user. Your blog will use this address to notify you of new comments to your posts and for other administrative purposes. To reiterate what was said above, only other registered users of your blog will have access to this e-mail address. It is never sent anywhere.Website – Enter your website address.\nAbout Yourself :\nBiographical Info – Enter a short description or profile of yourself here. This optional information can be displayed by your theme if so configured by the theme author. See the_author_meta('description') template tag.Profile Picture – Your picture in Gravatar is shown here. To change it, access to the https://en.gravatar.com/. See also Using Gravatars.\nAccount Management :\nGenerate Password – You can click this button to generate a new password for the account. This will show you a new field with the generated password. If you choose to change this password, a checkbox will appear to confirm that you want to use a weak password. You can check this box to confirm that you want to use your own password instead of a secure one.Strength Indicator This indicates if the password you entered is Very Weak, Weak, Medium, or Strong (displayed in green). The stronger the password the more secure your login. Hint: The password should be at least seven characters long. To make it stronger, use upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols like !”?$%^&).Log Out Everywhere Else – You can click this button to log out of other devices, such as your phone or a public computer.\nUpdate Profile\nRemember to click this button to save the changes you have made to your Profile and Personal Options.

In addition, you can search for  users, and you can make bulk changes and deletions to a selected group  of users.  \nUsers screen\nUsers\nTable of Users\nThe main part of the Users Screen displays a table of all the users listed by Username order.\n\nThe table of Users contains the following columns:\n\n[ ] check box – Check this box if this user is to  be affected by the Delete or Change User Role functions.  There is also  a checkbox in the column header to the left of the text Username–click  that checkbox to cause all Users to be checked.User Image – Avatar for this particular user. Username – The login of the User.  To edit a User, click on the Username link, the Users Your Profile Screen  will then display for you to make the necessary changes.  Also note  that if you hover the mouse anywhere over the whole row for a particular  user, the Edit and Delete links will be made visible for use.  The  current logged in user will not have the Delete link revealed.Name – The first and last names of the User.E-mail – The User’s e-mail address.Role – The Role assigned to that User.Posts – The number of Posts written by that User. Click on that number to be directed to the Posts Screen  to view or edit the Posts written by this User.  All users have a  unique identification number which WordPress uses to identify users  internally.  To determine that User ID, hover the mouse over the  Posts number link, and the User ID (author=x) will be revealed as part  of the URL in the browser status bar.\nSortable Columns\nSome column headings, such as the Username, Name, and Email, can be\nclicked to sort the Table of Users in ascending or descending order.\nHover over the column title, for example Username, to see the up-arrow\nor down-arrow.  Click the heading to change the sort order.\n\nPage Navigation\nUnder the Screen Options, the number of Users displayed per page is\ndetermined.  If more than one page of Users is available, two\ndouble-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided.\nAlso two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or\nforward.  Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to\nenter a page to directly display.\n\nScreen Options\nUnder the top shaded area is the Screen Options hanging tab.  Clicking on that hanging tab reveals the Show on screen  choices of E-Mail, Role, and Posts check boxes.  Unchecking a box causes  a column to be not shown in the Table below, and, of course, checking a  box causes that column to be displayed in the Table below. \nSearch\nAt the top right of the User Table is a search box to help find  users.  Enter a string in the box and click the “Search users” box.  Any  User that contains the search string in the Username, Name, E-mail, or  Website fields will be displayed, by Role.   You can then add, change, and delete those users.  A “No matching  users were found! ” message will be displayed if no Users can be found  that match the search string you entered. \nFiltering Options\nJust above the User Table, are filter links to All Users, and to\nlinks to Users belonging to the each of the various Roles.  Clicking on\none of those links, say Subscribers, will display all the Users assigned\n the Subscriber Role.  Click on All Users to again display all the Users\n in the table.\n\nUsing Selection, Actions, and Apply\nSelection\n\nThis Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more\nUsers selected in the Table.  For Bulk Actions to be performed on\nmultiple Users at once, those users must be first selected via one of these methods:\n\nSelect one User at a time – To select a User, the\ncheckbox to the left of the User entry must be checked (clicked).  It is\n possible to keep selecting more Users by checking their respective\ncheckbox.Select all Users in given Table – All Users in a given table\ncan be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table’s title, or footer\n bar.  Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox\nwill cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected). Reverse Selection – A Reverse Selection means checked items\nbecome unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse\nSelection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and\nclicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.\nActions\n\nActions describe the process to be performed on particular Users.  There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as Bulk Actions and Immediate Actions.  The follow describes these Actions:\n\nBulk Actions – These Actions can be performed on one, or more Users, at one time, if those Users have been previously selected.  Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk  Actions pull down box, above the Table.  The only Bulk Action allowed is  Delete.   Immediate Actions – Immediate Actions are performed  immediately, on an individual User.  Hovering the mouse cursor over the  User row reveals the Edit or Delete options under the Username column,  in that User row.  Clicking on a Username Name will also initiate the  Edit Action.\n\nThe available Actions are described below:\n\nEdit – This Immediate Action displays the Edit User  Screen.  This Action can be initiated by click on the Username or  clicking on the Edit option just below the Username.   Delete– This Action deletes the User.   \nApply\n\nAfter one or more Users are selected, and after a Bulk Action is specified, the Apply button performs the given Action on the selected Users.\n\nApply – Click the Apply button to execute the  Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pull down, on the selected Users.   Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Users must be selected, as described before.\nDelete Users\n\nAvailable as both Bulk Action and an Immediate Action, the\ndelete user capability is allowed on all but the current user (you\ncannot delete the user doing the deletion!).  After the Delete action\nhas begun, a Delete Users Screen will display with a message “You have\nspecified these users for deletion:” with a list of the Users you are\ndeleting with the following question:\n What should be done with posts and links owned by this user?\n Delete all posts and links – Check this radio button and  click the Confirm Deletion button to delete the User(s) as well as any  posts and links attributed to those User(s).  Attribute all posts and links to – Check this radio button,  select a User from the adjacent drop-down box, and click the Confirm  Deletion button to attribute all the posts and links for the Deleted  User(s) to the User you selected in the pull down box.   \n\nUpon successful completion of the deletion process, a splash message\n box near the top of the Screen will display “x user(s) deleted”.\n\nChange Roles to\n To the right of the Action pull-down box is the  Change role to pull-down box.  Select a Role, and all the Users that have been selected (checked),  will be changed to that Role upon clicking the Change button.

H6> ...... transform text into blockquote--- .... horizontal line`..` ... transform text into code block\nKeyboard Shortcuts for Comments\nBeginning with WordPress Version 2.7, the ability to use keyboard shortcuts to browse and moderate comments was introduced. These keyboard shortcuts are designed to save time by allowing you to rapidly navigate and perform actions on comments. If your blog gets a large number of comments, you will find these shortcuts especially useful.\nActivating Keyboard Shortcuts\nKeyboard shortcuts are enabled on a per-user setting, and can be turned on by visiting the Profile panel in Administration Screens > Users > Your Profile. Check the Keyboard Shortcuts checkbox to enable keyboard shortcuts for comment moderation.\nPlease note, the keyboard shortcuts are designed to use both hands, simultaneously, on a QWERTY style keyboard layout.\nThe Meaning of Selected\nThe keyboard shortcuts are used for navigation and for actions. For any action to affect a comment, that comment must be first selected. The comment that is considered selected is indicated with a light-blue background. By default, no comment is selected, so, you will need to press either the letter j key, or letter k key, to start navigating.\nUsing Keyboard Shortcuts to Navigate Comments\nNavigating comments is accomplished with the j and k keys. When you first visit the Comments page, no comments is selected, so, first press the letter j, or the letter k, to select the first comment. After that, just press the letter j to move the select to the next comment.\nPressing j moves the current selection (light-blue background) down.Pressing k moves the current selection (light-blue background) up.\nNote that if you come to the bottom of a page of comments and press j again, you will be taken to the next page and the first comment of that next page will be selected. Likewise, pressing k at the top of a comment page will zoom you to the previous page, selecting the comment at the bottom of that previous page. This makes it very easy to navigate through a long list of comments to perform the necessary actions.\nUsing Keyboard Shortcuts to Perform Actions on Comments\nFor one of these actions to affect a comment, make sure the comment is first selected (see above).\nPressing a approves the currently selected comment.Pressing s marks the current comment as spam.Pressing d moves the comment to the trash (WordPress 2.9) or deletes the current comment.Pressing z restores the current comment from the trash or activates the Undo when that row is selected.Pressing u unapproves the currently selected comment, placing it back into moderation.Pressing r initiates an inline reply to the current comment (you can press Esc to cancel the reply).Pressing q activates “Quick Edit” which allows for rapid inline editing of the current comment.Pressing e navigates to the edit screen for the current comment.\nBulk Actions\nYou can also perform an action on multiple comments at once. First, you’ll need to select the comments for the bulk action, using the x key to check the checkbox for the currently selected comment. Shift-x can be used to toggle the checkboxes, inverting their state. Once you have some comments checked:\nPressing Shift-a approves the checked comments.Pressing Shift-s marks the checked comments as spam.Pressing Shift-d deletes the checked comments.Pressing Shift-u unapproves the checked comments.Pressing Shift-t moves the checked comments to the Trash.Pressing Shift-z restores the checked comments from the Trash.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/keyboard-shortcuts-classic-editor/", "title": "Use keyboard shortcuts (Classic Editor) – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Editor Shortcuts Note: This page lists keyboard Shortcuts for the Classic editor.

The images provided within Block Patterns are free to use on your site. However, because these images are being referenced from an external source (i.e. they are not added to your site’s Media Library), there is always a chance they could change or be removed.\nWe recommend replacing these images with your own content. \nWill Block Patterns be changed? Will changes to patterns that I use impact my site?\nNew Block Patterns will be continuously added and existing Block Patterns may be changed or removed over time.

The most frequently used blocks are listed at the top (based on your Preference settings). Hovering over each block will show you a preview of the block and a brief description of the block.\nYou can scroll down the list to find blocks in categories, like Text, Media, Design, Widgets, Layout, Theme, or Embeds, You also find third-party blocks from installed plugins. \nOnce you find the block, drag and drop it into the block editor.\n\nUsing the Block Inserter icon to the right of an empty block\nClick on the Block Inserter + icon to the right of an empty block. This will open a modal window with a list of the most frequently used blocks.  \nYou can also press the Enter/Return on your keyboard after selecting a block to create a new empty block, and click the + Block Inserter to the right of the empty block.\nAdd a block using the Block Inserter icon to the right of an empty block\nSelect a block from the list or click on the ‘Browse all’ button to get a list of all the blocks available in the WordPress block editor.\n\nUsing the Block inserter icon in between blocks\nWhen you hover over the gap between two blocks, you will notice a horizontal blue line appear with a Block Inserter + icon. You can click on this icon to open a modal window with a list of the most frequently used blocks.  \n\nHow to add blocks using the slash command\nYou can quickly add a block to your post or page using the slash command. This shortcut will help with your writing flow with fewer interruptions searching for a block.\nBegin by adding a new paragraph block by pressing Enter or Return on your keyboard.\nThen hit the forward-slash (“/”) key followed by the block name.

If you add a third-party block from the block directory, the corresponding WordPress plugin will be installed on your site. \nHow to search for blocks\nWhen you click the Block Inserter + icon to insert a new block, you can use the search box at the top to search for blocks. \nType in a block name or a keyword for example, \"image\" or \"heading\". Then a list of blocks that fit the search term will show up in the modal window. You can also see a preview of the block below the list of blocks.\nSelect the desired block with the mouse click, tap, or arrow keys. \nSearch for a block\nWhen you use the slash command to add a block, you get an auto-suggested list of blocks based on what you start typing. You can select from the list or keep typing until you find the desired block.\nHow to move blocks\nFor information on how to move blocks, check out this article: Moving blocks.\n\n\nChangelog\n2022-08-07Removed the Moving block section to a separate page. 2022-07-20Updated for 6.0 with content, videos, and screenshotsAdded section for nested block and block directoryAdded ALT tags for the images2020-06-04Corrected several typos.Change Inserter right of an empty block to the left of an empty block.Removed Inserter between blocks sectionImproved slash command optionChanged date format in the changelog2019-12-21Added summary paragraph on the topAdd a short video to demonstrate the search box of the inserter modalTightened up the language a bit. 2019-12-20 Updated graphics with a newer interface (WP 5.3)Added videos for demo purposesUpdated headings for better readability, Added text about Inserter, and Move handles\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/adding-a-new-block/", "title": "Adding a new block – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Go to the List of Blocks There are several ways to add a block to your post or page from the admin screen of the WordPress block editor when you are editing your post or page.

{"text": "\nWhen you start using the WordPress Block Editor or the Site Editor and you find the number of choices and panels overwhelming, you can use the Preferences feature to turn on/off the various options, to your liking. This helps to remove the distracting elements in the layout that get in the way of your writing and create an editing experience that you prefer.\nHow to find Preferences\nIn the WordPress Block Editor or the Site Editor, select the three vertical dots icon in the upper-right corner of the top toolbar. This opens up a drop-down menu. Select Preferences to open the Preferences dialog. \n\nPreferences in the WordPress Block Editor\nThis section covers preference settings when you are in the WordPress Block Editor. \nGeneral\n\nPublishing: This lets you customize the options related to publishing a post or page.\n\nInclude pre-publish checklist: By toggling this on, you are enabling an extra step to appear before publishing a post/page. You will be asked to review the settings for Visibility and Publish date and add settings such as Categories and Tags. This checklist will only appear after you click Publish. You can make the relevant changes and click Publish one more time to Publish the post/page.\n\n\nAppearance: This section covers preferences that are specifically related to how the editor looks and feels. \n\nSpotlight mode: When you toggle this on, WordPress Block Editor is set to Spotlight mode. All blocks are greyed out except for the one you’re working on so that you can focus on a single block at a time.\n\nSpotlight mode\n\nShow button text labels: When you toggle this option, it allows you to show text instead of icons in the Toolbar. This applies to both the Top Toolbar in the Block Editor and the individual Block Toolbar. \n\nTop Toolbar when the option is turned off\n\nTop Toolbar when the option is turned on\n\nAlways open list view: When you toggle this on, it opens the block list view sidebar by default, every time you open the Block Editor. This is helpful if you are one of those who use the list view all the time.\n\n\n\n\nReduce the interface: When you toggle this on, it creates a clean interface with fewer distractions while you’re writing. WordPress turns off various options and panels in the toolbar and removes breadcrumbs at the bottom of the editor. Keep in mind that these options don’t go away! They are simply hidden while you’re writing and, if you need them, they become visible when you hover over the Toolbar. \n\nToolbar when Reduce the interface is turned off\nToolbar when Reduce the interface is turned on \n\nUse theme styles: This option is what allows your editor to look like your theme so that, as you’re creating content, you have a strong sense of what it will look like upon publishing. If you’d rather focus on the content itself and not necessarily on how it will look, you can toggle this option off to have your theme styles removed. \n\n\nDisplay block breadcrumbs: When you toggle this one, WordPress Block Editor shows block breadcrumbs at the bottom of the editor. Block breadcrumbs allow you to easily get a sense of where you are in the content and offer a way to easily select parent blocks. This is particularly helpful when you’re dealing with layers of nested blocks or more complicated arrangements. \n\n\nBlocks\n\nBlock interactions: This section helps to customize how you interact with blocks in the block inserter\n\nShow most used blocks: When you toggle this option on, it enables a section in the Block Inserter that shows all the blocks that you use the most. This can be helpful to easily find the blocks that you use frequently to build your page or post content. \n\n\n\nContain text cursor inside block: This option aids screen readers by stopping the text caret from leaving blocks.\n\nVisible blocks: This section lets you disable blocks that you don’t want to appear in the inserter. They can always be toggled back on later.\n\n\nYou can search for blocks easily by typing in the name in the search box.\nYou can check or uncheck the boxes to show or hide the blocks from the list.\nAs you uncheck the blocks from the list, you will get a message at the top showing how many blocks have been hidden.\n\nPanels\n\nDocument settings: This section lets you choose what panels appear in the Page/Post Settings Sidebar. If you toggle an item off here, it will hide that section in the page/post settings sidebar. If you find that you don’t use a specific panel in the settings sidebar and want to simplify your editing experience, this option is helpful. \nAdditional: This section lets you add extra areas to the editor. \nEnable Custom Fields\nCurrently, you have the option to toggle on Custom Fields. Once you toggle on, click Enable & Reload for the changes to take effect. Keep in mind that this will reload the post/page for the change to take effect and it’s important to save your content first before changing this setting. \nEnable Custom Fields\n\nPreferences in the Site Editor\nThis section covers preference settings when you are in the Site Editor. There are fewer settings in the Site Editor but the options work similarly to the ones in the WordPress Block Editor Preferences.\nGeneral\n\nBlocks\n\n\nChangelog\n\nUpdated 2022-10-25\n\nAdded screenshots and content update for 6.1\nAdded content for Site Editor Preferences with screenshots\n\n\nCreated 2021-07-13\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/preferences-overview/", "title": "Preferences Overview – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "When you start using the WordPress Block Editor or the Site Editor and you find the number of choices and panels overwhelming, you can use the Preferences feature to turn on/off the various options, to your liking.

For example: https://example.com/[slug]\nThe URL slug is automatically pre-populated as a URL-friendly version of your post/page title. To change that, you can type into the Permalink text field. \n\n\nView Post: The link here is the complete URL of the post once it’s published. Clicking on this link will open the post or page in a new tab.\n\nTemplate popup for block themes\nTemplate: This setting controls which template is used by the page/post.

Once an item is placed into the trash, it remains there for 30 days (by default), then is permanently deleted. \n\nCategories\n\nThis feature is only available for Posts. \nEach post in WordPress is filed under one or more Categories. Categories provide a helpful way to group related blog posts together.

Each Category may be assigned to a Parent Category, allowing you to set a hierarchy within the Category structure.\nClick the Add New Category button.\n\nTags\n\nThis feature is only available for Posts.\nTags provide a useful way to group related posts together and quickly tell your readers what a post is about.

Unlike Categories, Tags are not required for posts. \n\nTo add a new tag to your post, type in the text box Add New Tag. Then press Enter or Return on your keyboard.\nIf the tag has already been created for a previous post, the Tags box will begin to auto-populate with matching tags.\nTo remove a tag, click on the X to the right of the tag.\n\nIf you have more than 3 tags that you frequently use on your Posts, they will be displayed under Most Used. Clicking on any one of them will add it to the current Post.\n\nFeatured Image\n\nFeatured Images (also sometimes called Post Thumbnails) are used in different ways depending on the theme.

Here you can write a one to two sentence description of the post or page. Depending on the theme, these excerpts can be used as a preview, in place of showing the full post or page content on different places such as the homepage, search results, or the archive page.\nIf the Excerpt is empty, WordPress automatically creates an Excerpt using the first 55 words of the Post.\nDiscussion\n\nHere you can control how people interact with your post through comments. \n\nYou can turn on comments on the Post by checking Allow comments.\nYou can also turn on pingbacks and trackbacks by checking Allow pingbacks & trackbacks. Trackbacks and Pingbacks both aim to provide some verification to blog commenting. This feature is only available for Posts.\n\nPage Attributes\n\nThis feature is only available for Pages.\nThis section allows you to set parent pages and change the order of your pages. \n\nUsing Parent Pages is a good way to organize your site Pages into hierarchies. A parent page is a top-level page, with child pages nested under it. Clicking inside the Parent Page text box will show the pages on the site in the hierarchy. You can select any page to be the top-level Page with the current Page as its child.\nYou can change the order that your pages are displayed when using a default menu by using the Order field. This sets the order in which your Pages are displayed in the Page hierarchy. \n\nHow to customize the Settings sidebar\nYou can change which sections appear in the sidebar of the WordPress Editor by using the Preferences tool. \nSettings sidebar for Site Editor\nThe settings sidebar in the Site Editor (only available if your site is using a block theme) is shown below:\n\n\nYou can find the name of the Template and what it’s purpose is. Under Areas, the Template Parts that make up the Template are listed. \nClicking on any one of the Template Parts in the list will navigate you to where that Template Part is located on the template page. It will also open up a new panel in the sidebar showing the details for that Template Part as shown below:\n\n\n\nUnder the Advanced section, you can change the Title, Area, HTML element for the Template Part and also add additional CSS classes. \nIf you are viewing a template that came bundled with your block theme and you have made changes to the template, you can clear the customizations by clicking the three-dot menu icon in the top right corner of the Template settings sidebar. This will open a drop-down menu. Select Clear customizations. This will reset the template to the default state and you will lose the changes you made to that template. \n\n\n\nChangelog\n\nUpdated 2022-10-26\n\n\n\n\n\nContent, screenshots, and videos updated for the 6.1 release\nLinked to the Preferences Overview page and removed content from here\n\n\nAdded settings for Site Editor\n\n\nUpdated 2021-02-22\n\nUpdated Preferences section ahead of WP 5.7 release.\n\n\nCreated 2020-11-26\n\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/page-post-settings-sidebar/", "title": "Page/Post Settings sidebar – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "The Page/Post settings sidebar is used to customize the key aspects of the page/post that is being published.

WordPress has blocks for all common content elements, and more can be added by WordPress plugins.\nThe anatomy of a block\nEach block consists of a Block Toolbar, a Block Settings Sidebar, and the Block Content. \nAnatomy of a block\nYou can edit, customize or move each block independent of the other blocks on the post or page. \nThe editing options in the Block Toolbar will vary based on the block you are currently editing. \nEach of the blocks comes with its own formatting settings in the Block Sidebar settings panel which gives greater control over the layout and the look and feel of the block.\nHow to add a block\nThere are different ways to add blocks to your post or page. You can add a block anywhere on the post or page using the + button (called the Block Inserter). You can also use the search feature to quickly find the block you want and add it to the post or page.\n\nDetails on how to add a block to your post or page can be found here.\nHow to configure a block\nEach block has its own set of tools to customize the layout and appearance of the block. \nBlock Toolbar\nSelect a block to reveal the Block Toolbar at the top of the block. \nBlock Toolbar for the image block\nThe Block Toolbar includes the formatting options for the selected block. These options in the Block Toolbar will vary based on the block that is being inserted. \nSome of the most common options in the Block Toolbar are as follows:\nTransform: Usually, the first option in the Block Toolbar is Transform (marked 1 in the screenshot below). This allows you to change the selected block into a list of other supported block types. \nBlock Toolbar options\nFor example, if you add a Paragraph block and want to change it to a Quote block, Heading block, List block, or Pullquote block, clicking this icon will give you the options from the drop-down menu. \nThe transform options will vary based on the selected block.\n\n\nWhen a block is transformed, the existing block styles are preserved after the block transformation.\n\n\nWhen a block is transformed, the additional classes added in the Additional CSS class(es) section under Advanced in the Block Settings sidebar are also preserved after the block transformation.\n\n\nDrag: Click and hold the icon that looks like six dots (marked 2 in the screenshot above) to drag the block to another section of the page.\nMove up/down: Click the up or down arrow(marked 3 in the screenshot above) to move the block up/down one position on the page. Read more about moving the blocks.\nMore Options: The three vertical dots(marked 4 in the screenshot above) open a menu with additional settings that help to further customize the block. Read more about the More options.\n\nNOTE: When you click the three dots to the right of the Settings ‘cog’ icon in the upper right corner and enable the View > Top toolbar option, the block toolbar is pinned to the top of the WordPress block editor (right under the top toolbar) instead of appearing directly above the block.\nBlock toolbar pinned to the top toolbar\n\n\nBlock Settings\nWhen you select a block, you will find additional settings in the sidebar to the right of the WordPress block editor. \nIn the sidebar, you can switch between settings for the current post or page (marked 1 in the screenshot below) and settings for the selected block (marked 2 in the screenshot below).\nTo show or hide the sidebar settings, click the ‘cog’ icon at the top right of the editor (marked 3 in the screenshot below).\nBlock and Post/Page settings in the sidebar\nThe Post/Page Settings is where you can add tags and categories, choose a featured image, and more — these are settings that apply to the entire post or page.\nThe Block Settings in the sidebar contain more advanced customization options for the specific block you’re working on. Each block has its own settings that you can explore here. The settings will vary based on the block you are working.\nBlock sidebar setting for Paragraph block\n\nAt the top of the Block sidebar setting(marked 1 in the screenshot above), you will find a brief description of the block. \nBelow this, you will find several advanced settings such as Color, Typography, Border, Dimension Controls for Margin, Padding, etc. \nClicking on the three-dot menu icon(marked 2 in the screenshot above) will open a panel with further customization options for the settings. \n\n\n\n\nSome of the blocks such as Image, Gallery, Quote, Social icons, Tag cloud, Separator, Table, and Buttons have a Styles panel with buttons to show the various display options. Hovering over each of the buttons will show a preview of the style.\n\n\nHow to reset controls\n\nIf you make customizations to the controls but want to revert back to the original settings, you can do so easily by selecting the three-dot menu icon (marked 2 in the screenshot above) and clicking Reset All. This resets the settings and removes all of your changes.\n\nReset option\n\nThe one section that is available in all Block Settings is the Advanced section (marked 3 in the screenshot above). Advanced opens up with these two options when you click on the down arrow (marked 4 in the screenshot above):\n\nHTML Anchor for linking directly to a section of your post or page.\nAdditional CSS Classes for adding a CSS class to the block letting you write custom CSS to style that specific block. A CC class can be a single word, such as special or a term made up of multiple words with each word separated by hyphens, such as special-class. You can add multiple classes to the same block by separating each class by a space. For example: special-class-1 special-class-2\n\n\n\n\nHow to lock and unlock a block\nYou can lock the movement and/or removal of a block. \nFrom the Block Toolbar, click the three-dot menu option and select ‘lock’. This will open a dialog box where you can check the options – ‘Prevent removal’ and/or ‘Disable movement’. Once you click ‘Apply’, the block is locked. \nBased on the settings you choose when you locked the block, you will not be able to remove the block or move the block. You will see a lock icon in the Block Toolbar and also in the List View next to the block.\n\nTo unlock a locked block, click on the three-dot menu in the Block Toolbar and select ‘Unlock’. This will open a dialog box where you can uncheck the options – ‘Prevent removal’ and/or ‘Disable movement’. \nOnce you uncheck both the options and click ‘Apply’, the block is unlocked. You will not see the lock icon in the Block Toolbar and also in the List View next to the block.\nWhen you uncheck one of the two options -‘Prevent removal’ and/or ‘Disable movement’ and click ‘Apply’, you will still see the lock icon in the Block Toolbar and also in the List View next to the block. Based on the option that is checked, you will not be able to remove the block or move the block. \n\nHow to remove a block\nTo remove a block, select the block and click the three dots in the Block Toolbar for the block. At the bottom of the menu, you find the option to remove that block.\nRemove a block\nHow to find a block or block pattern\nThe WordPress Block editor offers an array of blocks for every possible element you want to add to your site. To browse the list of blocks, click the + Block Inserter in the upper left corner of the editor.\nHere, you can find all the blocks divided into categories. When you hover over a block, it will show you a preview of the block with a brief description. Clicking on one of the block icons will add it to the post or page. If you know the name of the block, you can search for it in the search box at the top in the Block inserter.\nYou can also find the block patterns (predefined groups of blocks) available for your theme and the reusable blocks you have added to your site. \n\n\nHow to find the most used blocks\nYou can set the preferences to keep the most-used blocks at the top of the list of blocks when you click on the Block inserter. This makes it easier for you to choose from the most used blocks on your site.\nMost used blocks\nHere are the steps to set the preference to keep the most-used blocks at the top of the list of blocks:\n\nClick the ellipses icon (the three dots) at the top right corner of the editor screen.\nChoose Preferences > Blocks.\nToggle on ‘Show most used blocks’.\n\n\n\nTips when working with blocks\nSelecting multiple blocks\nYou can now select multiple blocks by partially selecting the contents inside the blocks – by mouse (drag), shift + click, and also the keyboard (shift + arrow).  This is helpful to move or transform multiple blocks at once, to change the Block settings on multiple blocks, group or stack multiple blocks etc.\n\n\nLinking to existing post or page\nYou can quickly add links to existing an post or page in your content.  Type two open brackets [[ in your content to show a list of posts and pages and you can select the one to link to, from the list.\n\n\nCreating reusable blocks\nTo avoid adding the same content to multiple posts or pages, you can save a block or group of blocks into a Reusable Block which can be reused on any other post or page. This will save you time and effort. Eg: contact information, business hours, social media accounts, call to action button etc. \nLearn more about Reusable Blocks here.\nGrouping blocks\nYou can group together multiple blocks into one group and treat them as a unit. This is helpful to edit, format (such as add a common background color, change the font color etc) or move a group of blocks. If you don’t want them to be in a group, you can Ungroup your blocks as well. \nLearn more about the Grouping blocks here.\n \n\nChangelog:\n\nCreated 2022-05-15\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/work-with-blocks/", "title": "Work with blocks – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Each content in the WordPress Block Editor is a block.

{"text": "\nYou can use the dimension settings in blocks to help you better customize your layout and design. These settings impact the dimensions of blocks in various ways, including how groups of blocks are placed alongside one another.\nThe dimension settings are available when you use the block editor. If you are new to the block editor, this guide will show you how to work with blocks. You can read more about the new block editor features and improvements in this article.\nHow to access dimension settings\nThe dimension settings can be found in the Block Settings sidebar of a block under the section Dimension. \nIf you don’t see the Block Settings sidebar, select the block you want to customize, then click the settings icon (a cog) that is to the right of the Publish or Update buttons in the WordPress Editor..\nBelow are a few examples from different blocks:\n\n\n\n\nEach block has different dimensions settings \nIn the Dimension section, click on the three-dot menu (also known as an ellipsis) to explore all the dimension settings that are not visible by default. \n\nOf note, the type of dimension settings you can see in your block depends on whether they have been supported by the block or not. \nIf you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking Reset All as shown in this article. This resets the settings and removes all of your changes. You can reset individual settings by clicking Reset on each setting. You can also reset all of them globally by clicking on the Reset All option.\n\nType of settings\nEach block comes with different dimension settings. \nPadding\nThis setting impacts the space between a block’s content and its border. You can either set padding for all sides or set different padding values for each side. To set different padding for each side, follow the steps in the Unlink sides section.\nBefore selecting the option to add individual padding values\nMargin\nThis setting impacts the space around a block. You can either set the margin for all sides or set different margin values for each side. To set different margins for each side, follow the steps in the Unlink sides section.\n\nPreview margin and padding\nWhen changing the margin or padding in a block, the editor will show the corresponding change, highlighted in a blue box around the block.\n\nBlock spacing\nThis setting impacts the space between nested blocks. This means that if you set block spacing for the entire block, you can change the spacing of the nested block within the parent block. You can find this setting in blocks like the Buttons block or Group block. \nWithin this setting, you can choose to set block spacing using different values: px, %, em, rem, vw, vh. \n\nMinimum height\nThis setting enables you to set a minimum height for the block. You can find this option in the Cover block. Within this setting, you can choose to set the height using different values: px, %, em, rem, vw, vh. \n\nUnlink sides\nBy default, the Padding and Margin settings will apply the same value to the four sides around the block. You can add a different value to each of the sides by clicking on the Link icon to the right. To return to adding the same value for all sides, just select the Link icon again.\n\n\n\nClicking on the Link icon enables the option to add different values for each of the sides\nSet custom size & change units\nYou can add custom values for a block’s margin, padding, or spacing, and also change the units to one of the following: px, %, em, rem, vw, vh.\n\nBlocks that have dimension settings\nVarious combinations of these options are available in the following blocks: \n\nArchives\nAudio\nTag Cloud\nTable of contents – not available in 6.1\nTable\nTerm Description\nSpacer\nPost Date\nHeading\nParagraph\nQuery Title\nPost Title\nVideo\nList\nMedia & Text\nVerse\nCategories\nComment Edit Link\nComment Date\nComment Reply Link\nAvatar\nSite Logo\nSocial Links\nGallery\nButton/Buttons\nCode\nColumn/Columns\nComment Author Name\nComment Content\nComments Title\nCover\nGroup\nHeading\nNavigation\nPost Author\nPost Author Biography\nPost Author Name\nPost Excerpt\nPost Featured Image\nRead More\nSeparator\nSite Tagline\nSite Title\n\nDemonstration\nThe following is a demonstration of various settings in action with the Post Featured Image, unlink the sides of the block, and use different units. \n\n\nChangelog:\n\nUpdated 2022-10-27:\n\nList block supporting dimensions options\nUpdate screenshots to match 6.1 interface\nInclude custom size & custom units\nAdd “Unlink Sides” as a separate section.\n\n\nCreated 2022-01-17\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/dimension-controls-overview/", "title": "Dimension Settings Overview – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "You can use the dimension settings in blocks to help you better customize your layout and design.

{"text": "\nThe Template Editor allows you to edit and create templates, using blocks. These templates control the layout of the posts, pages, or page types on your site.\nThe Template Editor is only available if your site is using a block theme or a classic theme that has enabled the Template Editor on the backend.\nAbout Templates\nWordPress uses templates to create the layout and structure for posts, pages, or specific page types on your site page. There are a few base templates that are generated when you select a theme. For example:\n\nThe Home template is used to display the site’s home page if your site is set up to display the latest posts on the home page.\nThe Index template is used to display the index page of all the blog posts.\nThe Page template is used to display the site’s pages if no specific templates are assigned to the page.\nMany block themes offer other built-in templates like the Single Post template to customize the layout of single blog posts, the 404 template to customize the layout of the 404 error page, the Search template to customize the layout of the search results page, and the Archive template for categories/archives page, etc.\n\nIn addition, your block theme may come bundled with custom templates.\nIn the Template Editor, you can find all the templates on your site, including any custom templates you created and the ones that came bundled with your theme. You can edit these templates and create custom layouts using blocks.\nWhen you make changes to a template, the editor updates the blocks on all pages/posts that use the template. These changes take precedence over your theme’s bundled template files.\nWhat you need, to use the Template Editor\nTo work with the Template Editor, you need to use a block theme on your site. A block theme is a theme that uses blocks for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer.  \nAll blocks that are available in the WordPress Block editor can be used in the Template Editor. To find block themes, from the WordPress dashboard, go to Appearance >  Themes and click Add New. In the Add Themes page, select Block Themes to find the growing list of Block themes in the WordPress theme directory. \nHow to find a block theme\nOnce you install and activate a Block theme on your site, go to Appearance > Editor (beta) to open the Site Editor.\nTwo ways to access the Template Editor\nThere are two different ways you can access the Template Editor depending on what type of theme you are using:\n\nIf you are using a block theme, you can access the Template Editor when editing posts or pages via the WordPress Block Editor and also via the Site Editor.  \nIf you are using a classic theme that has enabled the Template Editor on the backend, you can access the Template Editor only when editing posts or pages via the WordPress Block Editor.\n\nHow to use the Template Editor via the WordPress Block Editor\nTo use the Template Editor via the WordPress Block Editor, make sure your site is using a block theme or a classic theme that has enabled the Template Editor on the backend. \nTo edit a template\n\nClick Posts > Add New to add a new post or Pages > Add New to add a new page. \nThis opens the WordPress Block Editor. \nNavigate to the Post/Page Settings sidebar tab.\nUnder the Summary section, click the name of the template.

Click Edit template.\n\nHow to edit template\nThe Edit option is only available if you are using a block theme that lets you edit custom templates.\n\nThis opens the Template Editor and takes you to the template editing mode where you can make changes to the selected template. To go back to the WordPress Block Editor and continue making content changes, click the Back link at the top left corner.\n\nBack link in the Template Editor\n\nWhen you’re done making changes, select Publish. This will prompt you to save all the changes you made including the template and the post or page. \nClick Save to confirm the changes. \n\n\n\nWhen you make changes to a template, the editor updates the blocks on all pages/posts that use the template\n\nTo create a new custom template\n\nClick Posts > Add New to add a new post or Pages > Add New to add a new page. \nThis opens the WordPress Block Editor. \nNavigate to the Post/Page Settings sidebar tab.\nUnder the Summary section, click the name of the template. A popup will appear. Click the add template icon in the top right corner.\n\nHow to add a new template\nThis option is only available if you are using a block theme that lets you create custom templates.\n\n\nThis opens a dialog box where you can give a name for the custom template you are about to create. Make sure to give it a descriptive name that describes the purpose of the template e.g. “Full Width”.\nClick Create to open the Template Editor and go to the template editing mode where you can build the custom template using blocks. To go back to the WordPress Block Editor and continue making content changes, click the Back link at the top left corner. \n\nBack link in the Template Editor\n\nWhen you’re done making changes, select Publish.

You will be taken to the template of your home page (based on what you have set in the Reading Settings) and you can start editing this template.\nTo view the list of templates available for your site and switch between templates:\n\nClick on the WordPress icon (or Site icon if you have set one) to open the Site Editor left navigation.\nClick on Templates to view the list of templates.\nClick on any template name from the list to switch to that template. \n\n\n\n\n\nTo edit a template\n\nFrom the Site Editor (Appearance > Editor (beta) ), click on the WordPress icon (or Site icon if you have set one) to open the Site Editor left navigation.  \nClick on Templates to view the list of templates on your site, including any you have created and any that come with your theme. \nClick on any of the templates in the list to edit the template. From here you can customize the layout of the selected template using blocks.\nWhen you are done with the template customization, click Save. \n\nWhen you make changes to a template, the editor updates the blocks on all pages/posts that use the template.\n\nTo go back to the Site Editor, click on the WordPress icon (or Site icon if you have set one) to open the Site Editor left navigation and click Site.\n\nGoing back to Site Editor from Template Editor\n\n\nTo add a new template\nThe Template Editor displays the templates that you can add to your site.  \n\nFrom the Appearance > Editor (beta), click the WordPress icon (or Site icon if you have set one) to open the Site Editor left navigation. \nClick Templates to view the list of templates on the site.\nClick Add New button in the top right corner to show a drop-down menu with a list of all new templates you can add to your site.\n\nFront Page – to display the home page of your site if your site is set up to display a regular page for the home page.\nPage – It allows the creation of templates that can be applied to a specific page on the site or as the default page template (if not already defined by the theme).\nAuthor – It allows the creation of templates that can be applied to posts by a specific author on the site or as the default template for all authors (if not already defined by the theme).\nCategory – It allows the creation of templates that can be applied to posts by a specific category on the site or as the default template for all categories (if not already defined by the theme).\nDate –  It allows the creation of templates that can be applied to posts by date (if not already defined by the theme).\nTag –  It allows the creation of templates that can be applied to posts by tag (if not already defined by the theme).\nTaxonomy –  It allows the creation of templates that can be applied to posts by a specific taxonomy term (if not already defined by the theme).\nSingle item: Post – It allows the creation of post-specific templates.\n\n\n\nIf you already added a template from the Template Editor (for eg: Category), it will not display that template name (in this case, Category) in the drop-down menu, when you click Add New.\nAdd new templates\nOnce you select the template to add, you are taken to the Template Editor pre-populated with content. This means you would be presented with content already in the template rather than starting from scratch. You can design the layout further by adding or removing blocks from the template. \nTo add a new Page template\nTo create a custom page template, select Page from the drop-down menu after you click on the Add New button in the Template Editor. \nA new dialog will appear listing all the pages on your site. If your site has more than 10 Pages, the dialog box will also show a Search box and you can search by the Page name to find the one you are looking for.\nYou can select a specific page to apply the template. Once you select the page, you are taken to the Template Editor where you can design the layout of the template.\n\n\nTo add a single template for all post types and specific post types\nAuthor, Category, and Single item: Post allows you to create a single template for all the post types or a specific template for a certain post type.  This is helpful for example, if you want to show a grid of posts for a specific “photography” category but not change the default list style for others. \nTo create a custom category template, select Category from the drop-down menu, after you click on the Add New button in the Template Editor. A new dialog will appear with two choices:\nCreating templates for Category\nAll Categories – for creating the default category template. This is used as a fallback when a more specific category template does not exist. \nCategory – for creating a custom template for an individual category. Selecting this option will open a new dialog listing all the categories on your site. . If your site has more than 10 Categories, the dialog box will also show a Search box and you can search by the Category name to find the one you are looking for.\nCreating template for specific category\nOnce you make your choice between All Categories or Categories you will be taken to the Template Editor, where you can design the layout of the template.\nTo create a custom author template, select Author from the drop-down menu, after you click on the Add New button in the Template Editor. This will open up a dialog where you can choose between creating one template for all the authors (All Authors) or a specific template for a certain author(Author). If you choose a specific template for an author, you will be prompted to choose from the list of authors on your site.\nCreating templates for author\nChoosing the specific author for creating the template\nTo create a post-specific template, select Single item:Post from the drop-down menu after you click on the Add New button in the Template Editor. This will open up a dialog where you can choose between creating one template for all the Posts(All Posts) or a specific template for a certain Post(Post). If you choose a specific template for a Post, you will be prompted to choose from the list of Posts on your site.\nCreating template for Post\nCreating template for specific post\n\nTo add an archive and single template for custom post types\nArchive and Single item: If your site has Custom Post Types, like testimonials, movies, books, or recipes, you will also be able to create a separate template for their archive pages or single posts. \nFor eg: to create a custom archive template for a specific custom post type eg: Works, select Archive: Works from the drop-down menu, after you click on the Add New button in the Template Editor. This will open the Template Editor pre-populated with the content of the Custom Post Type. This means you would be presented with content already in the template rather than starting from scratch. You can design the layout further by adding or removing blocks from the template.\n\nTo create a single template for a single item in the Custom Post Type eg: Works, select Single item:Works from the drop-down menu, after you click on the Add New button in the Template Editor. A new dialog will appear with two choices: \n\nAll Works: for creating the default single template for all single items in the Custom Post Type. This is used as a fallback when a more specific single template for that custom post type does not exist. \nWorks: for creating a single template for an individual item in the Custom Post Type (in this example Works). Selecting this option will open a new dialog listing all the items on your site for that Custom Post Type (in this example Works). Once you make your choice between All or Single Item for the Custom Post Type you will be taken to the Template Editor, where you can design the layout of the template.\n\nTo create a new custom template\nA custom template can be assigned to any post, page, or custom post type. \nWhen you add a new template from the list of choices provided in the Template Editor, they are automatically assigned to their respective page, post, or post type. For eg: The Author template gets automatically assigned to posts based on authors. When you create a new custom template, it is not assigned to anything specific until you assign a template to the post or page.\nFrom the Template Editor, click Add New button in the top right corner and select Custom template.\n\nIn the dialog that appears, give a name for the new custom template and click Create. Make sure the name describes the template eg: Post with sidebar.\n\nYou will be taken to the Template Editor pre-populated with content and you can design the layout of the template further by adding or removing blocks. \nHow to assign a custom template to a post or page\n\nFrom the WordPress Dashboard, open the post or page that you want to assign the template.\nThis opens the WordPress Block Editor. \nNavigate to the Post/Page Settings sidebar tab.\nUnder the Summary section, click the name of the template. A popup will appear. \nIn the popup, open the drop-down list to find the list of all custom templates. Pick the template you want to assign to the post or page. \n\n\nChanging a page’s template affects that page only (not your entire site.)\nHow to rename custom templates\nYou can only rename a custom template that you created. This means the default templates in WordPress and custom templates that came bundled with your theme cannot be renamed.\nThere are two ways you can rename custom templates:\nFrom the top bar within a template\n\nClick on Templates to view the list of templates on your site.\nClick on the custom template you created, that you want to rename. This will open the template in the Template Editor.\nIn the Template Editor, click the down arrow next to the name of the Template in the top bar.

{"text": "\nYou can use the color settings in your block to set the text color, background color, link color, gradient options, and duotone filters for your content. They are designed to make it as simple as possible to update your block’s colors.\nThe color settings are available when you use the block editor. If you are new to the block editor, this guide will show you how to work with blocks. You can read more about the new block editor features and improvements in this article.\nThe color settings available will vary based on the theme and the block in use.\n\nHow to access color settings\n\n\nThe color settings can be found on the Block Settings sidebar of a block under the section Color.\nIf you don’t see the Block Settings sidebar, select the block you want to customize, then click the settings icon (a cog) that is to the right of the Publish or Update buttons in the WordPress Editor.\nIn the Color section,  click on the three-dot menu (also known as an ellipsis) to explore all the color settings that are not visible by default. Note that not every block supports all the color settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking Reset All as shown in this article. This resets the settings and removes all of your changes.\nType of settings\nEach supported block comes with different color settings.\nText and background colors\nThis option allows you to change the color of the text, and background on the block you are working on. A combination of these color settings can be used to call attention to your most important content.\nYou can pick a color from the color palette of your theme. You can also add a custom color from the color picker or enter the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values based on your brand. Click the two rectangle boxes next to the color slider to copy the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values. \n\nAccessibility tests are built into the editor to warn you when the text may become hard to read against the background color choices as shown below.\n\nLink colors\nOn some blocks, you will find the option to change the link color. \n\nGradient background colors\n\n\nSome blocks such as the Heading block allow you to set either a solid color or a gradient as the background. A gradient is a mix of two or more colors, displayed using a certain pattern (from lighter to darker, or one color blending into the other).\n\n\n\n\n\nA slider will appear that shows the two color points that make up the gradient. \n\nYou can click on any of the two color points to display the color picker for changing the color value. You can either choose a color from the color picker or enter the HEX, RGB, or HSL color values.\nYou can add additional color points if you like by clicking the + icon that appears when you hover over the gradient slider.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can choose between the Linear or Radial gradient type. The angle control shifts the position of the gradient.\nThe Linear type creates a gradient between the two colors along a straight line, whereas the Radial type starts from the center and moves to the borders.\n\n\n\nDuotone filter\nYou can create a two-tone color effect (called the duotone effect) on images without actually changing the original image\nThe duotone filter option allows you to add this filter color to your block content from the block toolbar. The filter can be black, white, or any other color combination of your choosing. The duotone effect works best on high-contrast images. \nTo get started, select the Duotone filter icon in the block toolbar. You can pick the two colors for the effect from the list of duotone presets provided in the drop-down. \nYou can also pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights by clicking on the Shadows /Highlights option which opens up the color picker and then selecting your custom color from the color palette. \nIf you want to remove the duotone filter you can click the Clear button found at the bottom-right of the color palette.\n\nBlocks that include color settings\n\nSocial Links\nGallery\nCalendar\nTable of Contents – not available in 6.1\nSocial Links\nButton\nAvatar – Duotone only\nCode\nColumn/Columns\nComment Author Avatar – Background only\nComment Author Name\nComment Content\nComment Date\nComment Edit Link\nComment Reply Link\nComments\nComments Pagination\nComments Pagination Next\nComments Pagination Previous\nComments Title\nCover – Duotone only\nGallery – Background only\nGroup\nHeading\nImage – Duotone only\nList\nMedia & Text\nNavigation\nParagraph\nPost Author\nPost Author Biography\nPost Author Name\nPost Comments Count\nPost Comments Form\nPost Comments Link\nPost Date\nPost Excerpt\nPost Featured Image – Duotone only\nPost Navigation Link\nPost Terms\nPost Title\nPreformatted\nPullquote\nQuery\nQuery No Results\nQuery Pagination\nQuery Pagination Next\nQuery Pagination Numbers\nQuery Pagination Previous\nQuery Title\nQuote\nRead More\nSearch\nSeparator\nSite Logo – Duotone only\nSite Tagline\nSite Title\nSocial Links\nTable\nTable of Contents\nTerm Description\nVerse\n\nDemonstration\nTo illustrate the above settings, below is an example of how to add custom colors so that the social link icons will match the branding on your site: \n\n\nChangelog\n\nCreated 2022-11-01\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/colors-settings-overview/", "title": "Colors Settings overview – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "You can use the color settings in your block to set the text color, background color, link color, gradient options, and duotone filters for your content. They are designed to make it as simple as possible to update your block's colors.

{"text": "\nYou can use the typography settings in your block to change the font and appearance of your texts. These settings include font size, line height, font style, font weight, text transform, letter spacing, font family, and text decoration. When combined, they allow you to have new ways to differentiate your content.\nThe typography settings are available when you use the block editor. If you are new to the block editor, this guide will show you how to work with blocks. You can read more about the new block editor features and improvements in this article.\n\nHow to access typography settings\n\n\nThe typography settings can be found in the Block Settings sidebar of a block under the section Typography.\nIf you don’t see the Block Settings sidebar, select the block you want to customize, then click the settings icon (a cog) that is to the right of the Publish or Update buttons in the WordPress Editor. \nIn the Typography section, click on the three-dot menu (also known as an ellipsis) to explore all the typography settings that are not visible by default. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying additional typography settings\nFrom the drop-down menu, select the typography setting that you want to add to the Typography section.  You can add as many settings as you like. \nThe full list of the different types of settings is listed below.\n\n\nIf you make customizations to these settings and want to revert back to the original settings quickly, you can do so by selecting the three-dot menu icon and clicking Reset All as shown in this article. This resets the settings and removes all of your changes. \nType of settings\nEvery supported block comes with different typography settings. \nFont family\nThis option allows you to change the font family for your text. The list of fonts available in the drop-down menu depends on your theme. \n\nFont size\nFont size allows you to adjust the size of your text. You can choose from preset sizes like (S)small, (M)medium, (L)large and (XL)extra large. You can also set a custom value by clicking the slider icon directly above the default selections. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you add a custom value, you can change the unit of font size by clicking the px icon on the right. You can choose between px, em, rem. Learn the difference between these units here.\n\n\nLine height\nThis setting sets the spacing above and below each line of text within a given paragraph. The default line height for most themes is 1.5. You can use the Line height settings to increase or decrease it to your liking. You can also add a custom number for the line height. \n\nLetter case\nThis setting allows you to set text in a block to three casing options: all caps (AB), all lowercase (ab), or the first letter capitalized (Ab).\n\nLetter spacing\nThis setting allows you to set the space between each individual character. You can also change the units from the default (px) to %, em, rem,vw and vh. Learn the difference between these units here.\n\n\nDecoration\nThe decoration setting allows you to add an underline or a line-through in the text.

The px unit does not change based on any other element and hence px units are not responsive. They are useful for maintaining consistent sizing for some elements. If you have elements that should not be resized, then using px unit is a good option.\nElement (em), root element (rem), %, viewport height(vh) and viewport width(vw) are relative units. They are suited for responsive designs because these units scale up and down based on other elements size. They also get interpreted into the equivalent px unit by the browser. \nem: Relative to the parent element\nrem: Relative to the root element (HTML tag)\n%: % relative to the parent element\nvw: Relative to the viewport’s width\nvh: Relative to the viewport’s height\nDemonstration\nTo see the power of these settings in action, here’s an example of using them to personalize a button. \n\n\nChangelog\n\nCreated 2022-11-01\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/typography-settings-overview/", "title": "Typography Settings Overview – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "You can use the typography settings in your block to change the font and appearance of your texts.

{"text": "\nBlock Patterns are a collection of designed core blocks that can be used in posts and pages. They are building blocks to get content created faster. Eg: a subscription form, a Call-to-Action, or a Price List.  \nLearn more on how to use Block Patterns\nThe Block Pattern Directory has a myriad of block patterns that work with any site. Themes can reference patterns from the Directory, without loading them with the theme on every site. This helps to share block patterns from one site to the next. \nIt is now possible for designers, site builders, and site owners to share their creations with the world and submit their best designs to the Block Pattern Directory. This is a great way where #nocode contributors can share their creations with the WordPress community, in addition to the WordPress Photo Directory.\nHow to submit a Block Pattern \nBefore your start, check out the guidelines for successfully submitting your pattern.\n\nKeep placeholder content to a minimum, a few lines will be enough to demonstrate most blocks.\nUse a descriptive name for your pattern. Names like “Test” or “My Pattern” will be declined.\n\nHere is how to create a new Pattern and submit it to the Block Pattern Directory: \n\nCreate an account on WordPress.org \nAfter you log in, go to the Pattern Creator page\nOn the page, you find a stand-alone block editor, where you can create your Block Pattern by adding and arranging the blocks. \nGive a Title for the Block Pattern. \n\n\n\nNow populate the canvas with the available blocks. \nUse the Block toolbar and block settings sidebar to configure the blocks.\nClick Save draft to save the pattern as a draft. When you are finished click on the Submit button. \nWhen you click the Submit button, you will be prompted to give your pattern a Title and a Description. Make it distinct and helpful to the reader. \nNext, you will be asked to select a Category for your pattern. Categories help people find patterns and determine where your pattern will appear in the WordPress Editor. This also corresponds with the categories listed in the Pattern Directory: Buttons, Columns, Footer, Gallery, Header, Images, Query, Text, and Wireframe. \n\n\n\nOnce you click Finish, you will be taken to a Thank you dialog. At this stage, your Pattern is pending review. Once your Pattern is approved and published in the public directory, you will receive an email.\n\n\n\nHow to view your Block Patterns\nClick View my patterns in the Thank you dialog that appears after you click Submit button in the previous step. \n\nThis will take you to the My Patterns page where you can browse all your patterns: draft patterns, submitted patterns and the onces that are pending review.\n\nHow to use the My Patterns page\nThe My Patterns page will list all your patterns: draft patterns, submitted patterns and the onces that are pending review. \n\n\nYou can use the filter at the top to show all the patterns that are in Drafts, Pending Review etc.\nYou can sort the patterns by Newest or show only the Favorites by using the drop-down in the top right corner.\nYou can click on any of the patterns to open it in the single block pattern view.\nYou can hover over a Pattern in the My Patterns page to display a menu at the bottom right corner with the following options:\n\nClick the heart icon to add the pattern to your Favorites list\nClick the down arrow icon to show a drop-down menu. Depending on the state of your pattern, you will see the following options in the drop-down. \n\nOpen in editor: You can open the pattern in the editor\nRevert to draft: This is for submitted patterns only. You can revert to a draft. \nDelete pattern: You can delete the pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the Copy button to copy the pattern (you can then go to a Block editor and click Paste to paste that pattern into your Block editor.)\n\nHow to use the single Block Pattern view\nIn the My Patterns page, click on any of the patterns to open the pattern in the single Block Pattern view as shown below:\n\n\nThe status of your pattern is displayed at the top. It also shows the vibsibility of your Pattern. Once a Pattern is approved it is visible to everyone. Until then the pattern is only visible to you.\nThe title of the Block Pattern that you gave when creating the pattern is displayed here.\nThe Categories you choose when submitting the pattern, is displayed here.\nClick Copy Pattern to copy the pattern. You can then go to a Block editor and click Paste to paste that pattern into your Block editor.)\nClick the heart icon to add the pattern to your Favorites list.\nClick the Options dropdown menu. Depending on the state of your pattern, you will see the following options in the drop-down. \n\nOpen in editor: You can open the pattern in the editor\nRevert to draft: This is for submitted patterns only. You can revert to a draft. \nDelete pattern: You can delete the pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can test your Pattern in varying screen sizes by clicking on the drop down and selecting a different screensize such as 1200px, 960px, 480px or 320px.\n\n\n\nThe frame where the Block pattern is displayed.\nClick Report this pattern at the bottom right corner to report a problem with the pattern.\n\n\nHow to edit a Pattern in the Pattern editor\nWhen you choose Open in editor either from the My Patterns page by hovering over a pattern or in the single Pattern view from the Options drop-down, it opens the Pattern in the Pattern editor.

Here you can edit the Title, Description and Categories for the Block Pattern and also add Keywords for the Pattern that helps people find your pattern.\nClick Submit to update the changes.\nAbout the media library in the Pattern directory\nThe Media Library for the Pattern Directory is powered by Openverse. You have direct access to the library of images published in the public domain or with the CC0 license, no attribution is needed. \nYou can search by keyword and then browse through the results to select the image you’d like to add to your block pattern.\n\nUsing the Openverse library helps in the following ways: \n\nThe user of the Block Pattern can be fairly certain they can use the image on their website. \nThe creator of the Block Pattern doesn’t have to upload an image to the Block Pattern Directory.\nThe image is visible on any site, whether it is locally hosted on someone else’s computer or on their development site, or in production. \n\nRestrictions\nAs with any public directory on WordPress.org, there are a few restrictions when creating Block Patterns  \n\nYou can only use Core blocks to create the Block Patterns.\nYou can only use the Openverse media. \nOnly core colors and duotone filters presets are available. \nImages need explicit size value/settings .\nDynamic blocks won’t work (Query Block, Site Title, etc).\n\nMake sure you read the official Pattern Directory submission guidelines.\n\nChangelog:\n\nUpdated 2022-11-28\n\nReworked the content and added screenshots for 6.1\n\n\n2022-10-25 Spelling, grammatical, and capitalization updates.

{"text": "\nGo back to the list of Blocks\nThe Template Part block is an advanced block introduced in WordPress 5.9 that can be used with a block theme or a theme that supports template editing. They often come with your theme and are used to organize and display your site structure. You can only use them while creating and editing templates to manage blocks in areas repeated across the website. For context, this block is best used to create areas like your site header and site footer. When you change blocks inside a template part, the editor updates the blocks on every block template that includes the template part.\nIn order to add a Template Part block, click on the add block button and select the Template Part block. You can also type “/template part” and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly. In many cases, you’ll also see options to select types of Template Part blocks, like Header and Footer when searching for this block. You can search for the header or footer in the block inserter to insert the blocks or use the shortcuts “/header” and “/footer”.\nDetailed instructions on adding blocks can be found here.\nAdding template parts\nYou can add templates when using the Template Editor or Site Editor to edit templates directly. After adding a template part, you can choose from existing parts or create a new template part:\n\nChoosing from existing template parts\nSelecting the button “Choose existing” opens a modal where you can search, preview, and select existing parts. These  parts will depend on what your theme has provided:\n\nCreating new template parts\nSelecting “New template part” will prompt you to add a name. It’s best to pick a descriptive name so that it’s easy to find in the future:\n\nClick on the create button to place the block and begin customizing. \nCreating new template parts from the template part list\nIf you are using a block theme, you can also create a new template part from the template part list in Administration Screen > Appearance > Editor (beta) > Template Parts. When you select the Add New button, a modal appears where you can add a name and select the area for the template part. You must provide a name in order to create a new template part:\n\nCustomizing template parts\nAfter adding or selecting a Template Part block, you can customize in various ways by adding additional blocks within it. To make it easier to find current template parts to edit, it’s recommended that you use one of the following options:\nUse List View when you’re editing a template to quickly identify the Headers and Footers in your content to edit.Use the template part focus mode described below.\nTemplate part focus mode\nTo make it easier to focus specifically on editing a single template part, like a Header or Footer, you can use a dedicated mode that only shows an individual template part. There are a few ways to access this mode:\nSelect the template part in the Site editor > Click on the three dot menu > Select “Edit Header” or the respective template part name. Select the template part in List View > Click on the three dot menu > Select “Edit Header” or the respective template part name. From the Browsing sidebar > Navigate to Template Parts > Select the template part you want to customize.From the Top Toolbar > Click on the three dot menu under “Areas” next to the template part you want to customize.\nHere’s a video demonstrating one of the ways to access this mode:\n\nReplacing one template part with another\nIf the theme has more than one template part for the same area, you can use the Replace option in the block toolbar to replace the current template part with another. If you don’t see this option, this is because the theme hasn’t provided multiple template parts for the same area.\n\nAdvanced Settings\nUnder Advanced settings, you can rename the template part and select an area: General, header, or footer. The panel also lets you change the HTML element and add CSS class(es) to your block.

If you toggle it off, more customization options will appear. \nOrder by\n\nNewest to Oldest (default)\nOldest to Newest\nAlphabetical A to Z\nAlphabetical Z to A\n\nSticky posts\nThis option allows you to choose between three options:\n\nInclude (default) – Displays sticky posts. \nExclude – Removes sticky posts. \nOnly – Shows only sticky posts. \n\nFilters\nThis option allows you to customize further what posts are being displayed.

{"text": "\nThe Navigation Block is an advanced block in WordPress 5.9 that enables you to edit your site’s navigation menu, both in terms of structure and design. The Navigation block can be used with a block theme or a theme that has support for template editing.\nIn order to add a Navigation block, click on the add block button and select the Navigation block. You can also type “/navigation” and hit enter in a new paragraph block to add one quickly.\nDetailed instructions on adding blocks\nBlock Configuration\nAt a high level, there are three ways to add links to the Navigation block:\n\nSelect an existing menu: You can choose a menu you have already created on your site.\nAdd all pages: You will be able to add every existing page of your site, which you will be able to edit and rearrange.\nCreate empty: This creates a blank menu for you to add pages or links of your choice.\n\n\nSelect an existing menu\nIf you have a menu you’ve already created with the Navigation block or one from a previous theme, you can choose to use it upon setting up the Navigation block. To do so, add a Navigation block and choose “Select Menu”. From there, you’ll see all the menus you’ve created, including menus from any classic themes that you can select and use. \n\nAdd all pages \nBy selecting this option, you can automatically add all pages on your site to the Navigation block to then customize as you want. This option can help streamline menu creation, depending on the number of pages you have on your site. If you add new pages, they will automatically appear in this menu. \nIf you’re unable to see this as an option when setting up your menu, it’s due to there being a limited amount of space where the block is being added. When that happens, the setup state simplifies to just “Start Empty” and “Select Menu” to make it easier to get started.\nIf you use this option, you’ll need to do the following to move around the menu items:\n\nSelect an individual menu item in the Navigation block that you’re unable to move around or move a block near.\nClick on “Edit” in the Block Toolbar. \nFrom there, select “Convert” on the pop up that appears. This will convert the menu items to links so that you’re able to move them around. \nYou will then see the options to move around your menu items.\n\nBelow is a video showing the steps below. \n\nStart empty to create a new menu\nAfter adding a Navigation block, select the “Start empty” option. From there, you can customize to your liking by having a blank canvas to build from.\nBlock Customization\nAdd additional menu items\nThere are a few ways to add additional menu items to the Navigation block:\n\nOpen the Inserter and select a block to add. \nSelect the overall navigation block and select the + button that appears upon doing so.  After selecting the + icon, you will see a section under “Transform” where you can add additional blocks beyond links too.\n\n\nKeep in mind that you are only able to add a smaller selection of blocks to the Navigation block at this time. This includes the following blocks:\n\nSpacer block\nCustom link\nPost link\nPage link\nCategory link\nTag link\nHome link\nPage list\nSearch\nSocial Icons\nSite Logo\nSite Title\n\nEach comes with their own level of customization after adding. After adding one of these options, you’ll then be shown additional options when adding more blocks to your Navigation block:\n\nAdd submenu items\nTo add submenu items, simply select the block you want to add submenu items to and, in the block toolbar, click on the submenu icon. This will automatically add a submenu item below the block you selected.\n\nBelow is a video demonstrating this feature in action:\n\nMove blocks\nThere are two ways you can move blocks once you’ve added them to the Navigation block. Using these tools, you can rearrange each menu item as you’d like. \nIf you are trying to make quick changes, the movers in the toolbar that you normally see when interacting with blocks are likely the easiest option:\n\nFor more advanced and complex moving, check out the List View built into the Navigation block. To access this, select the overall Navigation Block then select the List View Icon:\n\nBelow is a video demonstrating the movers in action:\n\nIf you’re unable to move around all menu items or certain menu items, it’s likely that you need to convert the menu to links first. This happens if you use the “Add All Pages” option and there are instructions for how to convert to links in the section above.\nChange links and title\nEach block added to the navigation menu has two parts to it: a link and a title. \nTo change the title, you can edit the block text directly. \nTo edit the link, simply select the individual block and select the link icon in the toolbar. From there, an option will open up allowing you to edit what the menu item links to and the title. Below is a demonstration of this functionality: \n\nTransform menu items into other blocks\nEach block within the Navigation block can be transformed to other blocks via the Transform menu. This option makes it easy to build your menu with different blocks. \n\nManage menus (delete, rename)\nIf you want to delete the currently selected Navigation Menu, expand the Advanced section within the settings sidebar for the block. Selecting the Delete menu button will delete the Navigation Menu and reset the current Navigation block to its default state. \nTo make it easier to delete and rename all of your menus in one place, click on the “Select Menu” item in the toolbar and click on “Manage menus” as shown below:\n\nFrom there, you will be taken to a dedicated screen for deleting and renaming the menus used across your site. You will not be able to edit your menus directly from this section.\nUse a menu across themes\nThanks to how menus are saved in the database, you will be able to reuse menus across other Block themes. If you go from a Block theme to a Classic theme, you will not be able to re-use the menus you created with the Navigation block. \nBlock Toolbar Options\nEach block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor.\n\nThe Navigation block has the following options:\nChange Justification\n\nJustify items left: align the overall block and it’s contents to the left. \nJustify items center: align the overall block and its contents to the center. \nJustify items right: align the overall block and its contents to the right.\nSpace between items: automatically add space between menu items.\n\n\nSelect Menu\nThis option allows you to change the menu being displayed. \nList View\nThis offers a limited List View that allows you to move around the blocks within the overall Navigation block. \nBlock Settings\nEvery block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar. You can use these settings to customize the overall block.  If you do not see the sidebar, simply click the ‘cog’ icon next to the Publish button.\nLayout\nLayout settings allow you to change the justification and orientation of child blocks nested inside their parent blocks, with layout controls found on the parent blocks.\nThis article provides details about layout settings. \nDisplay\nCurrently, this section consists of one setting that allows you to control what is shown for the Navigation block across different screen sizes, allowing for a responsive menu option:\n\nOff: This turns off displaying a menu icon when on smaller screen sizes. \nMobile: This enables a menu icon to be displayed when viewing your site on smaller screens that one can click on to see the entire menu. \nAlways: This enables the menu icon to be displayed regardless of screen size. \n\nAt default, this option is set to Mobile, meaning it will show a menu icon on smaller screen sizes automatically. When you click on the menu icon, it will open up an overlay that shows your entire menu. \nColor\nThese color settings allow you to customize the appearance of your Navigation block. Pick a color from the suggestions, or add a custom color using the color picker or by adding a color code.\nSee this guide for more information about changing colors.\nTypography\nTypography settings allow you to change a block’s font size, appearance, line height, letter casing, and spacing.\n\nGet more details about changing typography settings.\nDimensions\nThe Navigation block currently supports Block Spacing, which allows you to add custom spacing between each block. This makes it easy to set a uniform appearance across the entire block.\nLearn more about dimension controls.\nAdvanced \n\nThe advanced tab lets you accomplish a few things:\n\nRename the menu.\nDelete the menu.\nAdd an HTML anchor.\nAdd a CSS class in order to style the block as you’d like.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nCreated 2022-01-05\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/navigation-block/", "title": "Navigation Block – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "The Navigation Block is an advanced block in WordPress 5.9 that enables you to edit your site's navigation menu, both in terms of structure and design.

Please continue reading the Detailed Upgrade Instructions.\nRemember, if you do encounter problems, re-read the Instructions below to insure you’ve followed the proper procedures and consult  Troubleshooting: Common Installation Problems.\nUpgrading Across Multiple Versions\nWhile the methodology given below is the “safe” approach, as long as you have proper backups, then it is indeed possible to upgrade directly from the very first version of WordPress to the very latest version in one-easy-step. WordPress does support this process, and WordPress is extremely backwards compatible in this respect. That said, if you have a large site, the upgrade process may take longer than expected, in which case an incremental approach may help. Just remember to retain a backup of a working site so that you always have a fallback position.\nIf you plan on upgrading across more than two major releases, you should consider upgrading incrementally to avoid potential conflicts and minimize the risks of database damage. Older versions of WordPress can be downloaded from the release archive.\nWordPress 3.7 introduced an easy to use one-button updater which will take you directly to Current Version. This update step is safe, and it is possible to one-click update from 3.7 to any later version.\nStep 1: Back up your database\nPerform a backup of your database.  All of your WordPress data, such as Users, Posts, Pages, Links, and Categories, are stored in your MySQL database.  Please read Backing Up Your Database for a detailed explanation of this process.\nIt is extremely important to back up your database before beginning the upgrade.  If, for some reason, you find it necessary to revert back to the ‘old’ version of WordPress, you may have to restore your database from these backups.\nStep 2: Back up ALL your WordPress files\nBack up ALL of your files in your WordPress directory and your .htaccess file.  Typically, this process involves using an FTP program to download ALL your WordPress files from your host to your local computer.\nPlease read Backing Up Your WordPress Site for further explanation.\nIf you have made changes to any core WordPress files, or if you’ve got customized Plugins or Themes, you will want to have a good backup of those files.  It is extremely important to back up your files before beginning the upgrade.  If for some reason you find it necessary to revert back to the ‘old’ version of WordPress you will need to upload these files.\nStep 3: Verify the backups\nVerify that the backups you created are there and usable.  This is the most important step in the upgrade process!\nThe verification process involves making sure you can see the backup files on your local computer (or wherever you’ve stored them) and that you can navigate into any sub-folders.  If the files are in a zip file, make sure you can open the zip file.  Also consider opening a .sql file in an editor to see if the tables and data are represented.\nStep 4: Deactivate ALL your Plugins\nIn your Administration Screen, under the Plugins choice, deactivate any Plugins.  Because of the changes to WordPress, some Plugins may conflict with the upgrade process. If you’re not able to access the administrative menus you can deactivate all plugins by resetting the plugins folder.\nStep 5: Ensure first four steps are completed\nIf you have not completed the first four procedures, STOP, and do them!  Do not attempt the upgrade unless you have completed the first four steps.\nThe best resource for problems with your upgrade is the WordPress Support Forums, and if you have problems, the volunteers at the WordPress Support Forums will likely ask if you have completed the first four steps.\nStep 6: Download and extract the WordPress package\nDownload and unzip the WordPress package from https://wordpress.org/download/.\nIf you will be uploading WordPress to a remote web server, download the WordPress package to your computer with your favorite web browser and unzip the package.If you have shell access to your web server, and are comfortable using console-based tools, you may wish to download WordPress directly to your web server. You can do so using wget , lynx or another console-based web browser, which are valuable if you want to avoid FTPing. Place the package in a directory parallel to your current wordpress directory (like “uploads,” for example). Then, unzip it using: gunzip -c wordpress-Version.tar.gz | tar -xf - or by using: tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz \nThe WordPress package will be extracted into a folder called wordpress.\nStep 7: Delete the old WordPress files\nWhy Delete? Generally, it is a good idea to delete whatever is possible because the uploading (or upgrading through cPanel) process may not correctly overwrite an existing file and that may cause problems later.\nDO NOT DELETE these folders and files:\nwp-config.php file;wp-content folder;wp-includes/languages/ folder–if you are using a language file, and it is here rather than in wp-content/languages/, do not delete this folder (you might want to move your language files to wp-content/languages/ for easier upgrading in the future);..htaccess file–if you have added custom rules to your .htaccess, do not delete it;Custom Content and/or Plugins–if you have any images or other custom content or Plugins inside the wp-content folder, do NOT delete them.\nDelete these Files and Folders:\nwp-* (except for those above), readme.html, wp.php, xmlrpc.php, and license.txt files; Typically files in your root or wordpress folder.  Again, don’t delete the wp-config.php file. Note: some files may not exist in later versions.wp-admin folder;wp-includes folder;wp-content/plugins/widgets folder; You only see this folder if you previously installed the Sidebar Widgets plugin.  The Sidebar Widgets code conflicts with the built-in widget ability.\nHow to Delete? There are several ways to delete the files from your WordPress site.  You can use your FTP Client, or if you have access to SSH you can use that.  Some host providers also provide the ability to delete files and folders.\nUsing FTP to delete files and folders \nThe same FTP client you use for uploading can be used to delete files and folders.  If your FTP client does not appear to permit you to delete non-empty folders, check the available options for your FTP client. You’ll usually find an option that permits deleting non-empty folders. Deleting non-empty folders is a quick and thorough method cleaning out an old installation of WordPress.  It is recommended that once the deleting is done, you switch back to the original setting for safety reasons.\nUsing SSH to delete file \nIf you have a command-line login (ssh), you can enter the following commands to make backup copies of the files you need to keep and to delete ONLY the wordpress files in your directory (plus .htaccess). If you’ve customized other files (like index.php) not included by the cp commands below, copy them as well:\n[code language=”bash”]$ mkdir backup\ncp wp-config.php .htaccess backup\ncp -R wp-content backup\nrm wp*.php .htaccess license.txt readme.html xmlrpc.php\nrm -rf wp-admin wp-includes\ncp backup/wp-config.php .[/code]\nAfter you have finished with the upgrade, you can restore any customizations to your templates or plugins from your backup directory. For example, use cp backup/index.php . to restore index.php.\n Alternatively, using SSH, you could copy wp-config.php, .htaccess, and any content files you’ve added or altered into the new wordpress directory. Then, rename the old one (to archive it), and move the new one into its place.\nStep 8: Upload the new files\nWith the new upgrade on your local computer, and using FTP, upload the new files to your site server just as you did when you first installed WordPress.  See Using FileZilla and Uploading WordPress to a remote host for  detailed guidelines in using an FTP Client to upload.\nNOTE: If you did not delete the wp-content folder, you will need to overwrite some files during the upload.\nThe wp-content folder holds your WordPress Themes and Plugins.  These should remain.  Upload everything else first, then upload only those WordPress files that are new or changed to your new wp-content folder. Overwrite any old versions of default plugins with the new ones.\nThe WordPress default theme has changed so you will want to upload the wp-content/themes/default folder.  If you have custom changes to the default theme, those changes will need to be reviewed and installed after the upgrade.\nStep 9: Run the WordPress upgrade program\nUsing a web browser, go to the WordPress admin pages at the normal /wp-admin location. WordPress will check to see if a database upgrade is necessary, and if it is, it will give you a new link to follow.\nThis link will lead you to run the WordPress upgrade script by accessing wp-admin/upgrade.php. Follow the instructions presented on your screen.\nNote: Make sure the database user name registered to WordPress has permission to create, modify, and delete database tables before you do this step. If you installed WordPress in the standard way, and nothing has changed since then, you are fine.\nIf you want to run the upgrade script manually:\nIf WordPress is installed in the root directory, point your browser to: http://example.com/wp-admin/upgrade.phpIf WordPress is installed in its own subdirectory called blog, for example, point your browser to: http://example.com/blog/wp-admin/upgrade.php\nIf you experience difficulties with login after your upgrade, it is worth clearing your browser’s cookies.\nStep 10: Update Permalinks and .htaccess\nIn your Administration Screen > Settings > Permalinks screen update your Permalink Structure and, if necessary, place the rules in your .htaccess file.  Also see Using Permalinks for details regarding Permalinks and the .htaccess file.\nStep 11: Install updated Plugins and Themes\nPlease visit individual plugin and theme pages and look for the compatibility information with your new WordPress version. Install new versions of your Plugins and Themes, if necessary.\nStep 12: Reactivate Plugins\nUse your Administration Screen, Plugins, to activate your Plugins. If you are not sure if they will work correctly with the new version, activate each plugin, one at a time, and test that there are no problems before continuing.\nStep 13: Review what has changed in WordPress\nPlease review these resources to see what’s new in WordPress:\nVersion history\nTroubleshooting\nScrambled Layout or Errors \nIf your blog looks scrambled now or features line errors, an old plugin that doesn’t work with the new code may be the culprit. In your WordPress Administration Screen, deactivate all plugins that do not come with WordPress by default. Re-activate them one by one.\nMade Custom Changes/Hacks? \nIf you have made changes to other WordPress files (“hacked” WordPress), you are supposed to keep track of your changes. You will have to transfer your edits into the new code. WordPress Versions lists the files that have changed in each release.\nResist Using Old Code \nUpgrading gives you the newest and best code. Using your old code, no matter how  much you have customised it, almost certainly will cause problems. The temptation just to use your old modified code will be great, but the chances of errors are much greater.\nCan I Go Back to Old Versions \nYou can, but it is usually not recommended to rollback (revert) your current version to an older version. That is because newer versions often include security updates and a rollback may put your site at risk. Second, the change between the database structure between versions may cause complications in maintaining your site content, posts, comments, and plugins that are dependent upon the information stored in the database. If you are still intent on this, proceed at your own risk. Please note, that without a backup of your entire site and your database, made prior to your upgrade attempt, a successful rollback is near impossible. Delete all WordPress files except for wp-config. Upload the files from your backup to your server and restore your database backup. Remember, you must have good backups for the rollback to work.  For older WordPress versions, a rollback might not work.\nGet More Help \nIf you get any errors following an upgrade, check Troubleshooting: Common Installation Problems, Troubleshooting, and the Installation Category of Articles.  If you can’t find an answer, post a clear question on the WordPress Suppport Forums. You will be asked if you have used any old code. You’ll be told to change it then, so you may as well change it now 🙂\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/upgrading-wordpress-extended-instructions/", "title": "Upgrading WordPress – Extended Instructions – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "This page contains a more detailed version of the upgrade instructions.

At any time, you can edit the images or settings of your gallery by clicking on the Edit button. You can remove the image gallery at any time by clicking on the Remove button.\nEdit image to edit\nGallery shortcode\nAbove steps generates Gallery shortcode with image ids and other options, and embedded into the Post or Page, like this:\n\nYou can specify options direct to this shortcode.\nUsage\nThere are several options that may be specified using this syntax:\n\nOptions\nThe following basic options are supported:\n orderby \nSpecifies how to sort the displayed thumbnails. The default is “menu_order.”\nOptions:\nmenu_order – You can reorder the images in the Gallery tab of the Add Media pop-up.title – Order images in the Media Library, based on the image title.post_date – Sort images by date/time.rand – Order images randomly.ID\n order \nSpecifies the sort order used to display thumbnails. ASC or DESC. For example, to sort by ID, use DESC:\n\n columns \nSpecifies the number of columns. The gallery will include a break tag at the end of each row, and calculate the column width as appropriate. The default value is 3. If columns is set to 0, no row breaks will be included. For example, to display a 4 column gallery:\n\n id \nSpecifies the post ID. The gallery will display images which are attached to that post. The default behavior, if no ID is specified, is to display images attached to the current post. For example, to display images attached to post 123:\n\n size \nSpecifies the image size to use for the thumbnail display. Valid values include “thumbnail,” “medium,” “large,” “full” or any other additional image size that was registered with  add_image_size(). The default value is “thumbnail.” The size of the images for “thumbnail,” “medium,” and “large” can be configured in the WordPress admin panel under Settings > Media. For example, to display a gallery of medium sized images:\n\nSome advanced options include:\n itemtag \nThe name of the XHTML tag used to enclose each item in the gallery. The default is “dl.”\n icontag \nThe name of the XHTML tag used to enclose each thumbnail icon in the gallery. The default is “dt.”\n captiontag\nThe name of the XHTML tag used to enclose each caption. The default is “dd.” For example, to change the gallery markup to use div, span and p tags:\n\n link\nSpecify where you want the image to link. The default value links to the attachment’s permalink. Options:\nfile – Link directly to the image file.none – No link.\n\n include\nComma-separated attachment IDs that include only the images from these attachments.\n\n exclude\nComma-separated attachment IDs that exclude specific images from these attachments.

{"text": "\nGo back to the list of Blocks\nThe Reusable Block allows you to save a block or group of blocks which you can later use in any post or page on your site. If you are often adding the same content to the same block or group of blocks, using the Reusable Block will save you time and effort. \nCreate a Reusable Block\nLet’s say you have a paragraph block which you often fill with the same text at the end of your post. This could be everything from how to get in touch to your business hours to your social media accounts. To avoid having to add the same content to a paragraph block every time you want to place it at the end of your post, you can make it a reusable block. To accomplish this, follow these steps:\nSelect the block or blocks you want to turn into a reusable block. Click on the three dot menu that opens up the additional settings.Click on “Add to Reusable Blocks”.This will open a prompt where you can then name your reusable block. Make sure to be descriptive so you can easily find it in the future. Select “Save” to confirm the creation of the new reusable block. \n\nYou’ll then be able to locate the reusable block among the other blocks inside the Reusable Blocks section of the Block Inserter:\n\nUse a Reusable Block\nAfter you’ve created a Reusable Block, you can then use it wherever you’d like. Since this is a more advanced block, you’ll also have a few more options for adding one into your content: \nClick on the add block button and search for the name of the reusable block you want to use. You can type “/” followed by the name of the reusable block you want to use. You can open up the Block Inserter and switch to the Reusable Blocks section to add whichever option you want. \nAfter inserting the Reusable Block you want to use, make sure to select ‘Convert to Regular Block’ option shown below if you wish to make any changes to the block on that page or post only:\n\nDetailed instructions on adding blocks can be found here.\nSelect and Edit a Reusable Block\nIf you’d like to edit a reusable block, you can do so in two ways:\nYou can add the block directly into a post or page and edit it from there. If you do this, you’ll see the reusable block mentioned in the saving flow when you save the post or page itself. You can go to Options > Manage Reusable Blocks, which will take you to a specific interface where you can directly edit reusable blocks as you’d like. \nIf you edit the block directly, you can easily tell where the reusable block content begins and ends thanks to a border that will appear around the block’s boundaries:\n\nKeep in mind that, when a reusable block is changed, the change will be reflected in all the places where the same reusable block was used.\nRemove a Reusable Block\nTo remove a block from reusable blocks, click on the three dots, and select the option to Manage Reusable Blocks. From there you can edit and delete reusable blocks as you’d like.\nKeep in mind that, when a reusable block is removed, the removal will be reflected in all the places where the same reusable block was used.

{"text": "\nOverview\nWhen creating or editing a WordPress page or blog post, you can easily add images at any time using the WordPress Media Uploader tool. Here’s how to add an image, step-by-step, using the media uploader:\nStep 1 – Placing your cursor\nPlacing cursor where the image should appear\nIn order to add an image to your page or post, you must first insert your cursor in the place in the text where you want the image to appear. By placing your cursor within your text, you can add images inline with your content. You can also place your cursor on a blank line if you want the image to appear by itself instead.\n\nTip: It’s a good idea to place your cursor on the left margin of your text, even if you want the image to appear on the right. That’s because there is a special setting called Alignment that allows you to control whether the image appears on the right or the left side of the text. It even controls how text flows around the image automatically.\nStep 2 – Click the Add Media button\nOnce you’ve placed your cursor on the line where you want your image to appear, click on the Add Media button to launch the media uploader interface, and then select the Insert Media option from the list of actions in the left side of the media uploader window.\n“Add Media” button above editor\nStep 3 – Add or Select Your Image\nYou can add or select the image you want to add to your page or post by choosing from either of the following options in the center of the media uploader window:\nUpload Files: Upload the image you want to use from your computer by dragging it into the upload area.Media Library: Select from any previously uploaded images in the media library by clicking on the one you wish to add to your page or post.\n\nOnce you have selected or uploaded the image you want to add, You will see a checkbox next to the thumbnail confirming your selection, and see information about it displayed in the Attachment Details pane on the right hand side of the media uploader interface.\nStep 4 – Attachment Details\nAttachment details\nThe Attachment Details pane displays a small un-cropped thumbnail of the image, as well as important information such as the filename, date uploaded, and image dimensions in pixels.\nThere are also action links that allow you to Edit Image, which takes you to the page, or to Delete Permanently to remove the image from your site.\nIn addition, you can edit the following media information:\nTitle: The title of this media.Caption: The caption for this image. The text you enter here will be displayed below the image.Alternate Text: Enter the Alt text for the image, e.g. “The Mona Lisa” to describe the media.Description: A description for this particular media.\nFor more information on these media settings, see the Edit Media page.\nStep 5 – Attachment Display Settings\nAttachment display settings\nThe Attachment Display Settings pane controls how the image is displayed when viewed on the site.\nYou have options to set how you would like the image aligned on the page (in relation to the text and margins) and what the link behavior of the image will be, In addition you can set what size image you would like to display on your page.\nImage Alignment\nThe Alignment setting allows you to determine where you would like the image to appear in your content area and how it interacts with any text on the page. You have the following image alignment options to choose from:\nLeft: Aligns the image on the left hand margin, and any text that is on the page wraps (or flows) around the image to the available space on the right.Right: Aligns the image on the right hand margin, and any text that is on the page wraps (or flows) around the image to the available space on the left.Center: Aligns the image to the center of the page, with no text displayed around it.None: Inserts the image in to the page with no alignment\nAligning images using editor controls\nImage Link\nThe Link To settings determine the URL/web address to which the image will be linked when clicked on by a visitor to your site. You can specify the following image link settings:\nAttachment Page: Links your inserted image to its WordPress media attachment page.Media File: Links your inserted image directly to the original, full-size version of the file.Custom URL: Allows you to set a custom link URL for your inserted image to link to when clicked.None: This setting will remove the link completely, rendering the image “un-clickable”.\nImage Size\nThe Size settings determine the size of the image you are adding to your site. By default WordPress creates a range of four image size for you to choose from:\nThumbnail: Displays a small thumbnail-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note, by default the Thumbnail size is a square, so some cropping of your original image may occur.Medium: Displays a medium-sized version of your image on the page/post. This is a good size to use with Left/Right alignments, as it leaves sufficient space for legible text to either side.Large: Displays a large-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space.Full Size: Displays a full-sized version of your image on the page/post. Note: WordPress will determine the width of the content column of your theme, and display the largest possible image for that space. If your original image is larger than this column width, the full size of the image may not be displayed.\nDifferent image sizes\nYou can visit the Settings>Media section of your WordPress dashboard to customize the above image sizes.\nStep 5 – Inserting the image\nEdit image option\nOnce you have determined your image settings, click on the blue Insert into post or Insert into the page button, to add the image to your page or post. After the image uploader window closes, you will see the image in the text editor window, including a preview of the alignment of the image, if you have specified an image alignment.\nAt any time, you can edit the image settings by clicking on the Edit Image button in the upper left hand corner.

{"text": "\nThe size and quality of an image for use on a web page is determined by a variety of things.\nPhysical Size \nThe physical size of an image is based upon two things: The size of the image on the screen and the file size. Generally, the file size is treated as a different issue.\nFile Size \nThis is the size of the file on your hard drive or server.\nResolution \nResolution refers to the number of pixels in an image. Resolution is sometimes identified by the width and height of the image as well as the total number of pixels in the image.\nFile Type \nThere are basically X image types popularly found on the Internet: jpeg,gif,png and (for favicons (the icons next to the address)) ico.\nThe physical size of the image is information we need to know in order to determine how much “space” will the image occupy on a web page. If your WordPress Theme features a fixed width content area of 600 pixels and the image you want to use is 800, the image will push the sidebar and layout of your web page around, messing up your design.  Images within that 600 pixel width need to be restricted to that maximum width in order to protect the layout of your page. It’s up to you to determine what size they should be from there, matching the image to your overall layout and styles.\nFile size dictates the time it takes to load your page, the larger the file size, often increased because of a high image resolution quality, the longer it will take to load.  People often don’t have the patience to wait through long web page loads, so keeping your file sizes low speeds up your web page access times. Typically, large high quality images should be kept between 100K and 60K.  Smaller images should be closer to 30K and lower.\nThe resolution of the image dictates its clarity. The higher the resolution, though, the larger the file size, so you have to make a compromise between quality and file size.\nLuckily, the various file types most commonly used on the Internet have compression features. When you save the file as one of these types, it condenses or compresses the data information in the image file.  Internet browsers can decompress this information to display the image on the screen.  Some graphic software programs allow you to set the compression rate to control the quality of the image (and file size) at the time you save it.  Depending upon your use of the images on your site, you may have to experiment with this to get the right ratio that keeps the resolution quality good while maintaining a small file size.\nWebsites use four common file types. The end of a filename (called the extension) tells what type it is.  One type, ico, is to make a favicon file — but this is usually only done when a website is first set up.  The other three types are used for general images:\njpg (JPEG) is good for photographs.  Saving a photo as jpg removes detail from the photo.  Good photo editors let you control how much detail is removed (the “compression”).  Different photos need different compression; doing this carefully and viewing the result can give you a usable photo with a small file size.gif can be poor for photographs.  It’s better for line art, like logos, with solid areas of the same color.png is for both photographs and line art.  It compresses photos without losing detail, but usually makes larger photo files than JPEGs.  Some older browsers don’t completely support png, though.\nIf you aren’t sure which file type is best for a particular image, try saving the image in more than one type and comparing the file sizes.  Using the right type can make a big difference!  There’s more information in Sitepoint’s GIF-JPG-PNG What’s the Difference article.\nResizing Images\nNot all graphic software packages allow you to resize images, though most should. Check your graphics software table of contents or index for resize, size, transform, reduce, or enlarge, all synonyms for the for the same thing.  If they don’t have the feature, you may have to find different software.\nThe process of resizing images is fairly simple. There are usually two methods:\n1) You can resize an image through the use of tools provided which allow you to manually shift the edges of an image to deform or resize the image. The best way is to grab a corner, not the edge, to resize the image. The corner “handle” will usually resize the image maintaining the overall height-width ratio. Check your manual for specific instructions.\n2) The other method involves simply specifying the image’s final size. The advanced graphics programs allow you to set it by exact dimensions or a percentage of reduction or enlargement.\nAfter resizing the image, the image may be smaller, but it may also be slightly out of focus. You can sharpen the focus of the small image by using the sharpen feature in your software.\nWhen you have fine-tuned your small sized image or new thumbnail, export the image as a jpg, gif, or png.\nResources\nImage File Formats on the WebGIF, JPG and PNG – What’s the Difference?\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/image-size-and-quality/", "title": "Image Size and Quality – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "The size and quality of an image for use on a web page is determined by a variety of things.

To reach the Edit Media page, go to Media > Library and click the name of the media item or the Edit link that appears below the name on hover. You can also reach this page by clicking on the Edit link when adding new media to your site. \nThe data entered on the Edit Media page is often used by  attachment pages and galleries if the theme or plugin chooses to display  it, and the data is also used as the default values at the time an  image is inserted into a page. Once the image has been inserted as an  individual image, it becomes disconnected from the data in the media  library and you can use the Image Details screen to update it on a per-image basis. \nIn addition to managing meta data such as title, caption, alt  text, and description, there are also added controls for performing  basic media edits such as rotating, scaling, and cropping images.  For  more information see the Edit Image section.\n\nEdit Media Page\nTitle  \nThe name of the media. A title is displayed in the File column of the Media Library Screen and is often shown on attachment pages and galleries if themes or plugins are designed to display it. \nPermalink   \nThis is the URL of the media attachment page. There is also a link  to view the attachment page. Next to this, there may be a button to  edit the permalink—if there isn’t, you can change the permalink by  activating ‘Slug’ from the screen options and changing the slug’s value. \nEdit Image button   \n(Image files only) allows you to make edits such as rotate, scale, and crop. \nCaption   \nA brief explanation of the media. \nAlternate Text  \nThe alt text for the image, e.g. “The Mona Lisa” to describe the media.

The  edits you make to your image are non-destructive and you can  restore the image to it’s original (uploaded) specifications at any  time.  Here are the various controls available to you in this Edit Image mode: \nCrop  \nTo crop the image, first, click on the image and drag to make your selection. Once a selection has been made, then click the crop icon above the image to finalize the crop. You can use the Aspect ratio and Selection option to make further adjustments or use keyboard shortcuts to fine-tune your crop selection before clicking the crop icon.\nRotate left button  \nRotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise. \nRotate right  button\nRotate the image 90 degrees clockwise. \nFlip vertical  button\nFlip the image upside-down. \nFlip horizontal  button\nFlip the image left-to-right. \nUndo/Redo  button\nRemove or restore your last edit. You can click as many times as you want in succession to “step” through the edit history. \nScale Image \nProportionally scale the original image. For best results, scaling  should be done before you crop, flip, or rotate. Images can only be  scaled down, not up. The original dimensions are displayed as a  guideline above the box for entering new dimensions. Click Scale button to display the new scaled image. Also Restore Original Image button appears to allow you restore the change. \nRestore Original Image   \nIf changes have been made to an image, the Restore Original Image pull-down allows you to discard any changes and restore the original image.  Previously edited copies of the image will not be deleted. Press the Restore Image button to complete the action. \nRestore original image\nImage Crop \nUsed in combination with the Crop icon, this tool allows you to make the following precise adjustments: \nCrop Aspect Ratio: You can specify the crop selection aspect ratio then hold down the Shift key while dragging to lock it. The  values can be 1:1 (square), 4:3, 16:9, etc. If there is a selection,  specifying aspect ratio will set it immediately.Crop Selection: Once started, the selection can be adjusted by entering new values (in pixels). Note that these values are scaled to approximately match the original image dimensions. The minimum selection size equals the thumbnail size as set in the Settings Media Screen.\nThumbnail Settings\nWordPress thumbnails are smaller, usually square, versions of your main image. They are automatically created each time you upload a new image. By default, a WordPress thumbnail image is 150px x 150px, and cropped as a perfect square. (You can adjust this on the Settings Media Screen.)\nWhen editing an image, you have three options. You can apply your changes to\nAll image sizesThumbnailAll sizes except thumbnail\nThumbnail Settings\nSave \nUse this to save the changes made to an image and return to the Edit Media screen for this image.\nCancel\nUse this to cancel any operation that has been performed on the image in the current session. \nKeyboard Shortcuts\nWhen cropping your image, these keyboard combinations can ‘fine-tune’\n the size of the crop frame.

Customizing the image attachment details, such as the Title, Caption, Alt Text, and Description, in the Media Library window can also be helpful for SEO and future navigation of your media library.\nUpload or select an image from your Media Library, add image information, then press Select.\nResizing Images\nOnce the image is added to the editor, you can resize and align the images to better fit the surrounding content.\nResize an image by dragging its handles.\nTo resize an image, \n\nClick on the image to reveal the draggable resize handles. \nClick on the resize handles and drag the image to your desired size.\n\nAlternatively, on the right-hand side in the Block Settings, the image size can be fine-tuned by adjusting width and height dimensions. There are also some convenient options in the block settings for setting the image to 100, 75, 50, and 25% of its original size.\nAligning Images\nAlign an image within a paragraph block.\nIf you wish to align an image within a paragraph you will first need to insert the image just above the target paragraph block. \nAlignment buttons with Align Right highlighted\nFrom there, click on the image and select left or right alignment, this will merge the image into the paragraph block.\nFinally, resize the image to your desired width and height.\nWide and Full Width Images\nAs support for the new editor is added to our themes, you will begin seeing icons for Wide and Full Width images.

The duotone effect works best on high-contrast images, so it’s recommended that you use an image with a lot of large dark and light areas. You can also choose colors from your theme’s palette, or a custom color of your choice. Below is a video demo of this feature:\n\nYou can read more about the Duotone Feature.\nExternal Image Upload\nSometimes you use a tool like Google Docs to write or collaborate on posts. When you’re ready to put the content on your site, you may copy and paste them into the editor.\n\nOne problem is that those images are likely hosted somewhere else like Google and could easily become broken if a change is made. \nSo, If you copy and paste an image from a resource like Google Docs, a button will appear on the toolbar to upload it to the media library. Click that, and it will stay in the post, but also upload to your media library.  \nMore Options\nThese controls give you the option to copy, duplicate, and edit your block as HTML.\nMore options for the image block\nRead about these and other settings.\n\nBlock Settings\nEvery block has specific options in the editor sidebar in addition to the options found in the block toolbar.

You can also change the Image dimensions – width and height dimensions of an image in 25% increments, or in exact pixel dimensions. \n\nBorder\nThe Image block provides border settings options to add border color, width, and radius.\nFor details refer to this support article: Border settings overview\n\nAdvanced\n\nThe Title attribute field is designed to describe the role of the image on your page. Many devices and browsers don’t display this text. \nHTML anchor allows you to do “page jumping” to that specific image.

A fixed background means the cover image scrolls along with your page. Turning this option off embeds the image in place, so the image doesn’t scroll.\n\nRepeated background\n\nThe Repeated background option lets you repeat the same image to form a pattern in the cover block. For example, if you have a small image and you want it to repeat multiple times in the cover block, you can enable this option.\n\nYou can use the Repeated background toggle in combination with Fixed background, but Fixed background does not necessarily have to be turned on. Feel free to play around with these options to find what suits your needs.\nFocal Point Picker\nFocal point picker for the cover image\nIf the fixed background option is turned off, you will see the focal point picker. This tool lets you identify the main point of interest in the photo and highlight. Click on the picker to drag it to the spot you want, or use the left and top position percentages below to set it manually.\nDimensions\nThe Cover block provides dimension settings options to add padding and margin.\nFor details refer to this support article: Dimension settings overview\nDimension setting for the cover block\nColor\nThe Cover block provides color settings options to change the text, background, and link colors for the block\nFor details refer to this support article: Color settings overview\nOverlay Opacity\nColor settings for the cover block with an overlay opacity\nUsing the Opacity slider, you can set the opacity of the cover image’s overlay. Moving the slider right toward 100 makes the overlay darker and more opaque, and moving it left toward 0 makes the overlay lighter and more transparent. At 100, the overlay is completely opaque and the cover image is no longer visible. At 0, the overlay disappears completely, leaving only your image.\nIf you’re adding a title to your cover image, we recommend making the overlay at least somewhat opaque to make the title easier to read.\nTypography\nThe Cover block provides typography settings to change the font family, appearance, line height, letter spacing, decoration, letter case, and font size. \nFor details refer to this support article: Typography settings overview\nAdvanced\nThe Advanced tab lets you add HTML anchor and CSS class(es) to your block.\nAdvanced settings for the cover block\nHTML anchor allows you to make a unique web address for a particular Cover Block.

Media Library lets you select a file that’s already uploaded to your site’s Media Library.

{"text": "\nWhat is a Theme?\nFundamentally, the WordPress Theme system is a way to “skin” your WordPress site. Yet, it is more than just a “skin”. Skinning your site implies that only the design is changed. WordPress Themes can provide much more control over the visual presentation of your content and other data on your WordPress site, as well as behavior of certain site’s elements while interacting with visitors.\nA WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a website. These files are called template files. A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image files (*.jpg, *.png, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (*.php). For an introduction to template files, see Template Files.\nLet’s say you write a lot about cheese and gadgets. Through the use of the WordPress Loop and template files, you can customize your Cheese category posts to look different from your Gadgets category posts. With this powerful control over what different pages and categories look like on your site, you are limited only by your imagination. For information on how to create custom look for various templates in your theme, take a look at Template Hierarchy.\nTemplate Hierarchy – the structure of WordPress theme files\nTo better understand this diagram, you can interact with it.\nDefault Themes\nWordPress currently comes with twelve themes: the default Twenty Twenty Two theme (demo), and the previous defaults Twenty Twenty One theme (demo) Twenty Twenty (demo) Twenty Nineteen (demo) Twenty Seventeen (demo) Twenty Sixteen (demo) Twenty Fifteen (demo) Twenty Fourteen (demo) Twenty Thirteen (demo) Twenty Twelve (demo) Twenty Eleven (demo) Twenty Ten (demo).\nThe Twenty Twenty Two theme is the first ever default block theme. It currently only works if you are using WordPress 5.9 and above or if you install the Gutenberg plugin alongside prior WordPress versions. \nNOTE: All default themes now come bundled with block patterns, which allow you to easily create beautiful layouts. Find out which patterns are added to themes on the Make WordPress Blog. \nYou can switch between Themes from the Appearance menu in the Administration Screen. Themes you add to the theme directory will appear in the Administration Screen > Appearance > Themes as additional selections.\nThemes Administration Screen – Installed Themes\nGet New Themes\nThe WordPress Theme Directory is the official site for WordPress Themes. Every theme in this directory is reviewed by a dedicated team and tested against wide range of rules, all of which are ensuring secure and pleasant experience for theme user.\nWith over 9,000 themes in the directory, you can easily find the right one for your site with advanced search feature using filters for layout, subject and specific theme’s features. This includes finding Block themes which support full site editing features. \nThemes Directory – Feature Filter\nIf you need more than a screenshot and features list to decide whether the theme fits your needs, you can see the demo for the theme with Preview feature on theme’s info page.\nTheme Info Page\nAdding New Themes\nMost of themes in WordPress Theme Directory come with installation instructions, especially the ones that may require more steps than the usual theme installation. Be sure to read through and follow those instructions for the successful installation of the Theme. If your Theme does not work after following any provided instructions, please contact the Theme author for help.\nAdding Block themes\nA block theme is a theme that uses blocks for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer. These themes are built for the newest features coming to WordPress that allow you to edit and customize all parts of your site. \nCurrently, you can add block themes in the same way you would any other theme. However, the Live Preview option is removed which means you will need to set up a test site first to explore the theme before activating if you wish to preview it. You also will not have the option to use the Customizer since block themes rely on the Site Editor to edit all parts of your site. In order to customize a block theme, you’ll need to activate it first. \nYou can read more about this current experience here. \nAdding New Themes using the Administration Screens\nYou can download any theme from WordPress Theme Directory directly to your site by using the Add New option in the Appearance sub-menu.\nLog in to the WordPress Administration Screens.Select the Appearance screen, then Themes.Select Add New.Either use the Search or Filter options to locate a Theme you would like to use.Click on the Preview link to preview the Theme or the Install link to upload the Theme to your site. Note that Or use the Upload Theme button at the top of page to upload a zipped copy of a Theme that you have previously downloaded to your machine.\n\nWhen the Theme is already downloaded but not activated Live Preview option will give you a preview of your site with your own, existing content.\nAdding New Themes by using cPanel\nIf your host offers the cPanel control panel, you can use its Upload option to upload the Theme files to your site. For this you will need Theme files in an compressed archive (.zip or .gz).\nDownload the Theme .zip file to your machine.In cPanel File Manager, navigate to your Themes folder. Depending on your hosting, path to Themes folder can differ a bit but essentially you are looking for public_html inside which you’ll find /wp-content/themes/.Once you’re inside the Themes folder in cPanel File Manager, click on Upload and upload that .zip file you saved in Step 1.Once the .zip file is uploaded, right click on the name of that file in cPanel and select Extract from the context menu.When Theme files are successfully extracted, follow the instructions below for activating the new Theme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tcPanel – File Manager\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tcPanel – Themes Directory\n\t\t\t\t\n\nAdding New Themes Manually (FTP)\nTo add a new Theme to your WordPress installation via FTP protocol, you’ll need FTP client and extracted Theme files.\nDownload the Theme archive (.zip) and extract the files it contains. You should have a folder named as theme itself, containing theme files.Using an FTP client to access your host web server and navigate to /wp-content/themes/ directory.Upload the Theme folder to this directory on your host server.Follow the instructions below for activating the new Theme.\nActivating the Theme\nNow that new Theme is in /wp-content/themes/ directory (whether you used Administration Screens, cPanel or FTP method), this new Theme is ready to be activated. All themes in /wp-content/themes/ directory are available for Activation and Update (when update is provided by theme author), but only one theme from this directory can be Active.\nWhen theme is Activated it means that this theme’s style and functionality (look and behavior) will be applied on your site. You will be informed by Administration notification about successful activation of the Theme.\nActivated Theme Notice\nTo activate a Theme for your site:\nLog in to the WordPress Administration Screens.Select the Appearance screen, then Themes.You should see here all themes from your /wp-content/themes/ directory and from here you can see details for each of them by clicking on Theme Details (rollover the Theme thumbnail).Live Preview option will give you preview of your site with your site’s content.To activate the Theme click the Activate button.\nYour selection will immediately become active.\nNote: If the Theme preview is blank, do NOT activate the new Theme without investigating further. Your site may not be displayed correctly, otherwise. If you do not see Theme’s thumbnail at all, your new Theme might be corrupted or broken. Take a look below installed theme’s thumbnails if there is any info about broken themes. In this case contact the Theme author for help.\nBroken Theme\nCreating Themes\nIf you are interested in creating your own Theme for distribution, or learning more about the architecture of Themes, please review the documentation regarding Theme Development.\nIf you simply want to customize your current Theme for your own use, consider creating a Child Theme.\nWhichever the case, you are welcome to join the Themes Team and their dedicated #themereview Slack channel.

{"text": "\nWhat is a Gravatar?\nWhen browsing different web sites, you may notice that many users have a picture next to their name.  These pictures are called “avatars.”  WordPress, however, uses a specific type of avatar called “Gravatars“–short for “Globally Recognized Avatar.” Unlike standard avatars, Gravatars follow you around the web and automatically appear when you post a comment on a WordPress site.\n\n\nA short introduction video presenting Gravatar\n\nWordPress integrates Gravatars into every WordPress site.  Once registered with Gravatar, the service matches your WordPress profile information to the email address registered with Gravatar and displays your custom Gravatar image next to comments and (optionally) elsewhere on the WordPress site.  If you choose not to sign up with Gravatar, the  default icon set by the Administrator appears next to your name.\nWhy use Gravatars?\nProviding your users with avatars has become a convention in web-publishing.  Enabling Gravatars on your WordPress site simplifies the process for everyone involved.  While it is possible to use a WordPress Plugin to manage user avatars on your WordPress-run site, using Gravatars on your site makes less work for both you and your site’s users.\nBenefits for Administrators\nYou can add user Gravatars with very little effortYou don’t need to maintain an additional PluginYou don’t have to manage user accounts, or their images, for commenters to use Gravatars on your site\nBenefits for Users\nYou don’t need to register for every site you visit just to use a GravatarYou can update the Gravatar you use across multiple sites by uploading a single image in a single place\nUsing Gravatars on your Site\nTo start using Gravatars on your site:\nLog in as an administrator to your siteNavigate to  Settings > Discussion and scroll down to the “Avatar” SectionThe “Avatar” section presents you with several options:Avatar Display: Toggle Gravatars on and off for your site.Maximum Rating: When users create a profile on Gravatar, they are given the opportunity to rate their Gravatar image as G, PG, R, X based on its appropriateness.  Select the radio button for the maximum rating you would like displayed on your site.Default Avatar: WordPress allows for you to select what image you would like to display when a commenter does not have a Gravatar account.  Selecting one of the “generated” icons give you and your users some of the benefits of a Gravatar without requiring them to have a Gravatar account.  The icons that say “generated” next to them take the email of the commenter and link it to an auto-generated image.  Now, every time that commenter posts to your site, they will have the same unique image next to their name.\n\nUsing Gravatar’s Hovercards\nIf you want to use Gravatar’s Hovercard feature, like on WordPress.com, you can install the Jetpack Plugin.\n\nResources\nIntroducing GravatarGravatar ProfilesGravatar Developer Resources\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/use-gravatars/", "title": "Use Gravatars – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "What is a Gravatar?

It is included in block themes and requires WordPress 5.9 or higher. \nYou can set the colors, typography, layout, spacing, and more, for the entire site and give your website a cohesive look that shows off your brand. \nYou can also edit the default appearance of blocks to streamline the look and feel of your website — add your unique colors to create a branded Button block, or adjust the Heading block to your preferred font size. \nHow Styles work\nThe styles you set from within the Styles interface impact your entire site. For eg: if you change the background color here, it changes the background color of all your posts, pages, and templates. \nIn the Styles panel, you will find the styles and default settings provided by your theme and the ones that come with WordPress. \nYou can override these settings with your own choices from the Styles panel. For eg: you can add your own custom colors to the color palette, change the layout dimensions, and more. \nStyles sidebar\nYou can also customize the appearance of specific blocks for the entire site. For eg: you can choose a background color and set the font size and line height for all the Quote blocks on your site. \nHow to use the Styles panel\nTo access this feature, you will need to install and activate a block theme and be using WordPress 5.9 or higher. \nGo to Appearance > Editor (beta).

{"text": "\nWhat are plugins?\nWordPress Plugins are PHP scripts that extend the functionality of WordPress. They enhance the features of WordPress or add entirely new features to your site. Plugins are often developed by volunteers and are usually free to the public.\nPlugins are available via the WordPress Plugin Directory. Although plugins you find here are thoroughly tested and considered safe to use, they are of varying quality and are often works in progress.\nHow do they relate to WordPress core?\nThe WordPress content management system software, or WordPress core, provides the primary functionality for publishing content and managing users. Each WordPress plugin is an additional piece of software that can be easily installed to extend the functionality of WordPress core.\nThis allows you to customize your WordPress site with your desired functionality. Since so much functionality is provided through plugins, WordPress core is full-featured and customizable, without having to include everything for everyone.\nWhat are some examples?\nSome of the more popular plugins in the WordPress Plugin Directory fall into these categories:\nSpam controlSEOData import and exportE-commerceSecurityCaching\nThis is just a small sample. There are thousands of plugins available in the directory, so there’s a good chance you’ll find some that are useful to you.\nFinding and Installing Plugins\nFinding Plugins\nYou can browse and search for plugins in the WordPress Plugin Directory. Each plugin listed there is available for download as a zip file you can upload to your WordPress site.\nAn alternative way to find and install plugins is from within the WordPress admin screens.

{"text": "\nThe layout settings in blocks allow you to change the justification and orientation of the nested child blocks inside their parent blocks.

The first icon in the block toolbar of the child block will select the parent block. In the block settings sidebar in the parent block, you will find the Layout section as shown below. \n\nNavigating through nested blocks\nThe List View tool can be used to navigate between layers of content and nested blocks. This will make it easy to access the parent and child block. \n\n\n\nTo open List View, select the List View icon from the Top Toolbar of the block editor as shown above. It will remain open as you navigate through your content and stay open until you close it by either selecting the “x” or by selecting the List View icon again.\nLearn more about the List View. \n\n\n\n\n\nType of settings\nEach supported block comes with different layout settings.

You can justify the child blocks to the Left, Center, or Right. \nSome blocks like buttons block will have the option to add Space between items which lets you add equal space between them. Space between items is applicable only for horizontal orientation. Eg: The buttons block is centered with equal spacing between the buttons if you have more than 1 button within the buttons block. If the child blocks are set to be vertically aligned, you will not be able to put space between them. \nThe justification settings can be found on the parent block’s toolbar and sidebar settings.   \n\nOrientation\nWhen you first add multiple blocks to a parent block, the child blocks will be displayed horizontally (i.e. next to each other.) \nAnother option is to display the child blocks vertically (i.e., stacked in the parent block). \n\nAllow to wrap to multiple lines\n\nBy turning on the Allow to wrap to multiple lines setting, the child blocks will move to the next line when there isn’t enough space on smaller screen sizes (mobile device). With this setting off, all the child blocks will stay on the same line no matter the screen size.\nCustomizing layout width\nSome blocks such as the Query Loop block that has nested inner blocks like Post Template block and Group block will have the following layout option that lets you choose the layout width for the nested blocks. \n\nToggle off Inner blocks use content width so that the nested inner blocks fill the width of the parent container.\n\nToggle on Inner blocks use content width so that the nested inner blocks use content width with options for full and wide widths. You can set the value for full width by typing in a value in the Content textbox. You can also set the value for wide width by typing in a value in the Wide textbox. You can also set the unit in PX, %, EM, REM, VW, or VH for the Content width and Wide width.

At a high level, this will focus on Template Part blocks, Reusable blocks, and Block Patterns. \nReusable block\nThe Reusable Block allows you to save a block or group of blocks which you can later use in any post or page on your site. For more information, you can learn more in the Reusable blocks support article. \nTemplate Part\nThe Template Part block is an advanced block that can be used with a block theme or a theme that supports template editing. They often come with your theme and are used to organize and display your site structure. For more information, you can learn more in the Template Part block support article. \nBlock Patterns\nBlock Patterns are a collection of predefined blocks that you can insert into posts and pages and then customize with your own content. For more information, you can learn more in the Block Pattern support article.\nHere’s a table comparing these different options to each other: \nTemplate PartReusable BlockPatternsTypeSite StructureUser ContentUser ContentSyncing AbilitySyncedSyncedUn-syncedExampleFooterBusiness hoursCall to action\nSite structure means it should not be a part of your content, like a post or page. Syncing ability touches on whether if you update it in one spot, it updates everywhere the same block is used. \nGuidelines\nBased on the above, this means it’s best to use template parts and reusable blocks for things you want to have in sync with each other whereas patterns are best for content that you expect to change across your site. \nIn general, template parts should not be added to a reusable block or a pattern since this is meant to represent site structure rather than content. A template part can include a reusable block though or be built using patterns! You can also use block patterns to build templates and template parts, but you should not use a template part inside a pattern.\nSituationals\nRepeated content across your site\nThis could be everything from how to get in touch to your business hours to your social media accounts. To avoid having to add the same content to a paragraph block every time you want to place it at the end of your post, you can make it a reusable block. \nRepeated structure across your site\nFor anything that’s more about site structure that’s repeated across your site, like a Header or Footer, it’s best to use a template part. These carry semantic meaning within block themes so it’s important to make the distinction. \nRepeated design or layout\nWhen it’s less about content and more about wanting to repeat a design or layout, patterns are best to use. This is because the content doesn’t need to be synced and, instead, what you want repeated is how something visually looks. \n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comparing-patterns-template-parts-and-reusable-blocks/", "title": "Comparing Patterns, Template Parts, and Reusable Blocks – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Overview With more types of reusable content you can create with WordPress, this article seeks to clarify when it makes sense to use certain types in different situations to help guide you to make the best decisions possible.

{"text": "\nA favicon (short for “favorite icon”) is an icon associated with a particular website or web page. It is generally intended to be used when you bookmark a web page. Web browsers use them in the URL bar, on tabs, and elsewhere to help identify a website visually. Favicons are also used as application icons on mobile devices.\nA favicon is typically a graphic 16 x 16 pixels square, and is saved as favicon.ico in the root directory of your server. You can use a favicon with any WordPress site on a web server that allows access to the root directories.\nWordPress Version 4.3 or later\nWordPress Version 4.3 implemented a Site Icon feature that enables favicons on your web site.\nWhen you use the Site Icon feature, you don’t need to prepare the favicon.ico file by yourself, or modify your template file. All you have to do is navigate to the Customize screen and specify a square image that has a height and width of at least 512 px.\nLater paragraphs in this article contain instructions for manually setting up your own favicon. However, it is highly recommended that you use the Site Icon feature (a feature that is built-in to WordPress) instead.\nFollow the steps below to use Site Icon to set up a favicon for your site.\nPrepare the image file. (It must be square, having a height and width of at least 512 px.)Navigate to Administration Screen > Appearance > CustomizeClick Site IdentityClick Select Image (located under the Site Icon subheading).Click on the Upload Files tab, then click Select Files to upload the image file that you prepared in the previous step.\n\nCreating a Favicon\nA favicon can be created by using any graphics/image editing software that allows the saving of .ico files. There are also online services that will allow you to create a favicon for free.\nThe image should be clear and visually appealing. Ideally it should be designed to match your site’s brand image and/or content.\nTo prepare the image to be saved as favicon.ico:\nMake the image square by cropping or adding space around it.Resize the image to 16 x 16 pixels.Save the file as favicon.ico.\nIf you’re using an online service to create your favicon (such as Faviconer.com or Dynamic Drive) follow the instructions provided by the site, and then download the favicon.ico image to your computer.\nInstalling a Favicon in WordPress\nIf your theme or your WordPress version does not support the Site Icon option described above, you can use this method to manually add a Favicon.\nIf there is already an old favicon.ico file in your current theme’s main folder, delete it using an FTP Client.\nUse an FTP Client to upload the new favicon.ico file into your current theme’s main folder.Upload another copy of your favicon.ico file to the main directory of your site (ex. http://example.com/favicon.ico). This will display the favicon in your subscribers’ feed readers.\nIn order for your favicon to show up in some older browsers, you will need to edit your page header. (Remember, the best way to edit your theme’s files is via a Child Theme. As you follow along with the following instructions, it is highly recommended that you create and modify the copy of header.php that is located in your child theme.)\nGo to your WordPress Administration Screen.Click on Appearance.Click on Theme Editor.Select the file called Header or header.php to edit the file.Search for the line of code that begins with <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" and ends with /favicon.ico\" />. Overwrite it, if it exists, or add the following code below the HTML tag:\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/favicon.ico\" />\nSave the changes.\nHow to create a favicon with a transparent background\nBefore implementing this method, please make sure that your source image already has a transparent background, which means it should be a GIF or a PNG. The rest of the steps are as mentioned above. The one difference in the code is that, instead of using a favicon.ico file, use favicon.png or favicon.gif instead.\nSearch for the line of code that begins with <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" and ends with /favicon.ico\" />. Overwrite it, if it exists, or add the following code below the  HTML tag:\n<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"<?php echo get_stylesheet_directory_uri(); ?>/favicon.png\" />\nTo see your new favicon, clear your browser’s cache. You may need to restart your browser in order to see the new favicon.\nAdvantages of using .ico over .png or .gif\nCompatibility – As of this writing, most modern browsers–except for iOS Safari and Opera Mini–support the .ico format.Avoid 404 server errors – Virtually all modern browsers will request a favicon.ico, so it’s best to always have a favicon.ico file, to avoid a “404 not found” error.An .ico file can hold more than one icon, so there is no need to include multiple files for 16×16 and 48×48 icons.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-a-favicon/", "title": "Create a Favicon – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "A favicon (short for \"favorite icon\") is an icon associated with a particular website or web page.

{"text": "\nAs of WordPress 5.9, block themes are now a part of the WordPress ecosystem as a new type of theme built with and for blocks. \nWhat is a block theme?\nA block theme is a theme that uses blocks for all parts of a site, including navigation menus, header, content, and site footer. These themes are built for the newest features coming to WordPress that allow you to edit and customize all parts of your site. This allows you to switch up key parts of your theme without ever needing to change themes. \nWith a block theme, you can place and edit blocks outside your content using the Template Editor or Site Editor. You can use blocks in templates provided by a theme or plugin. For example, an archive page or a 404 page. You can also create custom templates.\nFor general information about themes, see the support article What is a theme?\nHow do this impact widgets and widget areas?\nInstead of widgets, a block theme relies on blocks. This means that you can place blocks anywhere you might have previously wanted widgets to appear.\nHow does this impact the Customizer?\nThe Customizer is not available in block themes unless you are using a plugin or theme that requires it to be activated. This is because you can make the same changes you might make with the Customizer with blocks. For example, there are now blocks for the site title, tagline, and site logo. You can also select colors for your website in the Styles setting by going to Administration Screen > Appearance > Editor (beta). \nHow to find block themes\nYou can find block themes in the WordPress theme directory by selecting Block Themes in the toolbar. This automatically takes you to a filtered view of all themes with Full Site Editing functionality.\nThemes Directory – Block Themes\nFor general information about how to get new themes, see the support article Get new themes.\nWhat options are available with block themes?\nAfter activating a block theme, more tools and features will be available to you including the following:\n\nSite Editor: an editor that allows you to edit all parts of your site, navigate between templates, and more.\nStyles: a feature that allows you to customize your site, including individual blocks, as much as you’d like with different colors, typography, layouts, and more. \nTemplates: edit, create, and manage templates that a page or post uses.\nTemplate parts: a way to organize and display groups of blocks as part of a block template mainly for site structure, like Headers and Footers.\nTheme blocks including the Navigation Block, Query Loop block, and more. \n\nUsing these options you can create the desired look and feel of your site without switching themes as often. \nWhen should I use a block theme?\nBlock themes were introduced in WordPress since the 5.9 release. If you like exploring new things, enjoy building content with the block editor and like to have full control over all parts of your site, block themes are a great solution for you. \nIf you’re comfortable doing so, it might help to set up a test site to try out a block theme first to see if it will work for you. \nHow are block themes different from classic themes?\nBlock themes are built for the newer functionality in WordPress and allow you to use blocks to edit all parts of your site, including easier ways to quickly customize everything from your background colors to font sizes for all Heading blocks etc. Comparatively, classic themes are built with PHP templates, functions.php and more that include features like Widgets, a dedicated Menus section, the Customizer, and more. Classic themes do not work with the Site Editor. \nResource Links\n\nLearn WordPress course on Simple Site Design with Full Site Editing\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nUpdated section on how to find block themes 2022-07-14 \nCreated 2022-01-05\n\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/block-themes/", "title": "Block themes – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "As of WordPress 5.9, block themes are now a part of the WordPress ecosystem as a new type of theme built with and for blocks.

{"text": "\nWordPress has the ability to allow post authors to assign custom fields to a post. This arbitrary extra information is known as metadata. This metadata can include bits of information such as:\nMood: HappyCurrently Reading: CinderellaListening To: Rock Around the ClockWeather: Hot and humid\nWith some extra coding, it is possible to achieve more complex actions, such as using the metadata to store an expiration date for a post.\nMetadata is handled with key/value pairs. The key is the name of the metadata element. The value is the information that will appear in the metadata list on each individual post that the information is associated with.\nKeys can be used more than once per post. For example, if you were reading two different books (perhaps a technical book at work and a fiction at home), you could create a “reading” key and use it twice on the same post, once for each book.\nHere is an example of what this information might look like on your post:\nCurrently Reading: Calvin and HobbesToday's Mood: Jolly and Happy\nUsage\nBased upon our example above, let’s add two custom fields, one called “Currently Reading” and the other “Today’s Mood”. Please follow the below steps to add this information to a post using Custom Fields.\nCustom Fields options on the Post & Page edit screens are hidden by default if they have not been used before. Using the Block Editor, click the three dots button at the top of the right sidebar and visit Options to enable it. (If you are using the Classic editor, check the screen options).After you have written your post, scroll down to the area titled Custom Fields. To create a new Custom Field called “Currently Reading”, enter the text “Currently Reading” (without the quotes) in the text entry field titled Name.The newly created Key (“Currently Reading”) should now be assigned a Value, which in our case is the name of the book currently being read, “Calvin and Hobbes”. Type “Calvin and Hobbes” in the Value field, again without the quotes.Click Add Custom Field button to save this custom information for that post.\nCustom Fields\nTo add your “Today’s Mood”, repeat the process and add “Today’s Mood” to the key and a description of your mood in the value text boxes and click Add Custom Field to save this information with the post.\nOn your next post, you can add a new book and mood to your metadata. In the Custom Fields section, the Key will now feature a pull-down list with the previously entered Custom Fields. Choose “Currently Reading” and then enter the new book you are reading in the value. Click Add Custom Field and then repeat the process to add “Today’s Mood”.\nYou only need to create a new “KEY” once, after which you can assign a value to that key for every post, if you so desire. You can also assign more than one Value to a key, for a post. This will come in handy for people who read more than one book at a time.\nDisplaying Custom Fields\nTo display the Custom Fields for each post, you have to use a template tag that customizes your theme. For more details about it, please refer to:\nthe_meta() – Template tag that automatically lists all Custom Fields of a postget_post_custom() and get_post_meta() – Retrieves one or all metadata of a post.get_post_custom_values() – Retrieves values for a custom post field.Template Tags – WordPress Theme Developers Handbook page on Template Tags\nYou may install a plugin that manages custom fields by searching “custom fields” in the plugins directory.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/assign-custom-fields/", "title": "Assign custom fields – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "WordPress has the ability to allow post authors to assign custom fields to a post.

{"text": "\nThere are times when you need to test changes to your WordPress-powered site out of the public eye. Making changes to a live site could adversely affect your readers.\nYou have several choices.\nCreating a sandbox \nDo this for test driving your WordPress Theme and style sheet, allowing you to develop your WordPress Theme on your computer. This limits you to only working on CSS and not using plugins and other powerful features of WordPress. This is best for just styling a page.\nHiding your WordPress test area\nYou can also close off access to your WordPress test site on your website server. This involves some familiarity with .htaccess and Apache, but it allows you to continue working on the Internet while not exposing your test site to the public.\nInstall WordPress on Your Computer\nIf you are determined to put WordPress through its paces, you can install WordPress on your own computer with a few modifications. This allows you total control over the actions and capabilities of WordPress. You can still use plugins, template files, and themes, and redesign everything as if it were on the Internet without using bandwidth or suffering from slow Internet access times. We have two sets of explanations for this: Installing a New Installation on Your Computer and Installing an Existing WordPress Site. We also cover Moving WordPress Onto Your Website after you have finished developing your site on your computer.\nCreating a Sandbox\nA Sandbox is a term related to the sandbox you might have played in and built sand castles in as a child. It is a playground for working on concepts and exploring your imagination. A WordPress Sandbox is basically a copy of a generated page on a WordPress site that is saved to your hard drive for you to play with as you develop your final theme and look for your site.\nWordPress uses different template files to generate different views on your site. In general, there is the front page view, the single post view, and the multi-post view, used for categories, archives, and searches. For more information on the structure of WordPress Themes, see Site Architecture 1.5. As different page views use different CSS styles, at the least you need to put three page views in your sandbox following these instructions.\nChoose the WordPress Theme you want to work from in your Appearance screen of your Administration Screen.From your initial or test WordPress site, view one of the following page views:* Front Page* Single Post* Mult-Post PageFrom your browser:# Choose File > Save As.# Name the saved page with one of the above “titles.”# Save each page’s file to your sandbox folder.From your Theme’s folder, copy the style.css style sheet file to your sandbox folder.Open each of the three files you have saved in a text editor and change the following:\n<style type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\">\n@import url('/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/style.css');\n</style>\nto\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" href=\"style.css\" />\nLastly, find all the image files and graphics associated with the style sheet, like background images, icons, bullets, or others, and copy them to your sandbox folder. Links to these items from within your style sheet should have no folders in their links, or link to a subfolder within your sandbox folder, such as:\nheader {\n  margin:5px;\n  padding:10px;\n  background:url(images/background.jpg)....\n}\nTo test this, double-click on one of the pages in that folder to view it in your browser. If the styles and graphics are visible, it worked. If not, check the link to your style sheet.\nNow, you have a sandbox to play in.\nTo use your sandbox, have two programs open. One is your text editor with the style.css file and the other is your browser with the page you are working on in view. Make a change in your style sheet, save it, then do a total refresh of your browser screen and look at what changes. Then repeat the process. When you are done with one page, go to the next page and check those changes and add more if necessary.\nSandbox tips\nHere are a few tips for playing in your sandbox.\nBackup Frequently \nAs you work, copy the files in the folder before making major renovations to a backup folder. Or you can use a file compression utility like a zip program to save the entire folder. If the changes you make do not work, you have recent backups to work from.\nTrace DIVS and CLASSES \nBefore you begin, go through the source code file of each of the three-page views in your text editor and add a comment as to where each division begins and ends. These often cross lines between template files and can be difficult to trace. Make your life easier by documenting where these begin and end.\nMake Notes \nBefore making a huge change, write down what you are changing. This way you have notes to refer to when things do not work later and you are trying to trace the history of the changes.\nMake Notes Inside \nWhen making significant changes to the style sheet or to the web page source code, add notes or comments to the code. This will also help you to keep track of the changes you’ve made.\nMake Small Steps \nMaking a lot of changes at once makes it harder to find the small change that made things go out of whack. A good approach would be to take small steps and check, then make additional, small modifications and check again.\nAvoid Changing the Template Files \nBegin by staying with the site architecture and style references already in place. If you will be releasing your Theme to the public, modifications to the template files must be seriously reconsidered and done carefully. If you are rebuilding your site for your private use, then you can make those changes to your HTML saved pages source code, then move those changes into the template files later.\nMoving Your Sandbox To Your Theme\nWhen you have made all your changes and are satisfied with the results, it is time to move your sandbox back into your WordPress Theme.\nUpload the style.css style sheet file to your WordPress Theme folder on your site, replacing the old file.Upload all graphics and images to the Theme folder or subfolder.View your site in your browser. The changes should be immediate.If you made changes to the source code of any of the three pages, track those down to their specific template file and make the changes in those template files on your site.\nInstall another Blog\nInstall WordPress again, but in the wp-config.php file, use a different table prefix.In Options > Writing > Update Services, clear the box.Tell no one where your blog is located.\nIf you go to another site from your blog, then your site could be discovered because of the referer in the browser. To prevent this, go to your real blog, then to another site.\nThis method is useful toward the end of testing as you can ask for people to test using other browsers/screen resolutions.\nHiding Your WordPress Test Area\nTo hide your WordPress test folder from others, you can use the .htaccess file on an Apache web server. The .htaccess file is a file that stores server directives, and instructions that tell the server what to do in specific situations. You could also use the Apache config file (httpd.conf) or other methods, but the .htaccess file can apply only to the folder in which the .htaccess file resides, and all the folders under that one, allowing you to restrict access to a specific folder.\nRemember, this will only work on servers that support .htaccess. If you are unsure that your server supports .htaccess, contact your hosting provider. You may or may not be able to do this depending upon the access permissions you have with your host server. You may need their assistance. If you are running your own server, or if your hosting provider is clue-free, consult the AllowOverride documentation.\nUsing the .htaccess file, you need to provide instructions to tell the server to restrict or deny access to your WordPress test site. In the folder or directory in which WordPress is installed, do the following:\nUsing a text editor create a blank text file called .htaccess.You need the following information:* The full path of a directory on your site server that is not accessible to the public (like http://example.com/public_html/ is accessible but http://example.com/private/ is not. Use the latter.* The name of the secured area such as “Enter Password” or “Secure Area” (this is not important, just simple).In the file type the following, replacing /full/path/of/directory/ and Security Area with the above information:AuthUserFile /full/path/of/directory/.htpasswd\nAuthName \"Security Area\"\nAuthType Basic\nrequire valid-userSave this .htaccess file and upload it to the directory on your server you want hidden and secured. This would be the installation directory for WordPress such as /wordpress/ or blog.Using Telnet, cPanel, or another way to access your server’s command panel, go to the directory specified as AuthUserFile.Type the following command, where user_name is the user name for the access:htpasswd -c .htpasswd user_nameWhen prompted, enter the password, and confirm it.Write down your password and user name and keep it in a safe place.\nWhen you are ready to open your site to the public and remove the protection, delete the password and .htaccess files from their locations.\nIt is highly recommended that you remove the default ping URL to Ping-o-Matic!, otherwise your test posts will ping and your test blog will be made public though not accessible.\nHtaccess resources\n.htaccess files howtoAuthentication, Authorization and Access Control\nInstalling WordPress on a Mac\nUse these instructions for setting up a local server environment for testing and development on a Mac.\nInstalling_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP\nInstalling WordPress on Your Windows Desktop\nIn order for WordPress to work, it must have access to an Apache server, MySQL/MariaDB, and phpMyAdmin. Installing these separately can be painful. Luckily for us, XAMPP installs all of these with one program, allowing you to run WordPress on your computer. There are two versions of the program, Basic and Lite. The Lite version is usually adequate.\nDownload and install XAMPP.This installs by default into C:/xampplite or C:\\xampp.Start XAMPP from c:\\xampplite or c:\\xampp.You may need to restart your computer to allow apache services to start.In your browser, go to http://localhost/xampp.In the left column under Tools, click phpMyAdmin.Login is admin.In Create a new database enter wordpress.In the next box, select utf8 unicode ci.Click Create button.Unzip your WordPress download into the htdocs directory – c:\\xampp\\htdocs\\.From the folder, open wp-config-sample.php in a text editor.The connection details you need are as follows: // ** MySQL settings ** // define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');  // The name of the database define('DB_USER', 'root');  //  Your MySQL username define('DB_PASSWORD', ''); // ...and password define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');  // 99% chance you won't need to change thisSave as wp-config.php.Install by going to http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/install.php\nIMPORTANT: It is possible to use this to actually host your blog if you have a good enough connection. If you want to do this, you MUST increase the security level. This description is NOT SECURE if you allow web access to your blog.\nInstalling an existing WordPress site\nWith the help of XAMPP, you can install WordPress directly on your computer and play with it to your heart’s content. This way, it is totally isolated from public exposure and all your mistakes are hidden. When you are ready, you can then move it onto your website, ready for all to see.\nRequirements\nAccess to your server database.Ability to download your entire WordPress installation to your computer.Basic XAMPP for WindowsEnough room on your hard drive to accommodate your database, WordPress installation, and XAMPP.\nBackup WordPress\nphpMyAdmin MySQL Databases\nBegin by backing up your WordPress site completely, the files and the database. This will ensure that you have a good copy to fall back on, just in case.\nA second backup is then required of your database, but it requires you do a little housekeeping.\nAs the WordPress database normally stands, there are statistics tables that contain a huge amount of data which add to the overall size of the database and slow down the process of backing up and downloading this backup copy of your database. You do not have to clear these, but it is generally considered a good idea.\nLogin to PHPMyAdmin on your website server.From the main login screen, select Databases.Choose the name of your WordPress database.From the tags at the top of the screen, choose Export.In the frame at the top of the Export section you will see a list of tables in your database. You will need to choose only those tables that correspond to your WordPress install. They will be the ones with the table_prefix found in your wp-config.php file. If you only have WordPress installed, then choose Select All from the left column.Make sure the SQL button is selected.On the right side of the panel, make sure the following boxes are checked.\nphpMyAdmin export screen\n\n     * Structure\n     * Add AUTO_INCREMENT value\n     * Enclose table and field names with backquotes\n     * Data\n     Tick the Save as file option, and leave the template name alone.\n     For Compression, select None.\n     Click Go.\n     You should be prompted for a file to download. Save the file to your computer. Depending on the database size, this may take a few moments.\n\n\nDownload WordPress\nNow, download your entire WordPress site to your computer. This is usually done with an FTP client program. Make sure you include all core WordPress files within your root or WordPress directory, including the index.php.\nYou should now have in your computer two items:\nOne or more database backups.All your WordPress files, folders, and image directories.\nCopy the backup files again to somewhere safe on your machine so you work on a copy of the backup for the next stage.\nInstall Basic XAMPP\nInstall XAMPP. By default, it will install to C:\\xampp.Go to C:\\xampp\\apache\\conf and open the file called httpd.conf in a text editor.About line 166 you will find: #LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so.Remove the # and save the file (this switches mod_rewrite on).Create a folder inside C:\\xampp\\htdocs. This will be for WordPress.Copy all your downloaded WordPress files (not the sql backup) into that directory.With a text editor, open the file wp-config.php on your WordPress install.Change the details for your new MySQL connection: // ** MySQL settings ** // define('DB_NAME', 'wordpress');  // The name of the new database you made define('DB_USER', 'root');  //  keep this as is define('DB_PASSWORD', ''); // keep this empty define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');  // 99% chance you won't need to change thisYour main index.php should be in the /htdocs folder or in a subdirectory such as /htdocs/wordpress/. Write that down.Start XAMPP by clicking the orange xampp_start.exe or using the console program from Program Files\\ApacheFriends\\XAMPP\\XAMPP Control Panel.Once it is working, click on the link in the left sidebar for phpMyAdmin.Create a database. The name should match the one used in your wp-config.php file.\nImporting Your SQL Backup File\nBefore you begin to import your SQL backup file, you need to change some information inside your .SQL file.\nUsing your text editor, open the .sql backup database file you downloaded.Find and replace all the instances of your old URL with your new URL. For instance, if your blog address is at http://example.com/wordpress/, and your files on your computer are at /htdocs/wordpress/, replace it with http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/.Click Save – Do not use Save as.\nphpMyAdmin SQL tab\nNow it is time to import your sql file. From within the phpMyAdmin on your computer, click on your database name, then choose the SQL tab. From this screen, click Browse and find your backup files on your computer. Click Go. This can take a few minutes to import.\nSuccess message\nOnce the procedure is complete, your database will be restored and will work just as it did before. If something goes wrong with this last part of the process, it could be that either your backup was corrupted in some way, or something went wrong with the database itself. Keep your backup files safe!\nIf everything so far has gone well, it is now time to visit your blog! In your browser, type in http://127.0.0.1/wordpress/index.php or the actual name of the folder you created for your WordPress files.\nIf you get a 404, check you have the right place. You do not need to put htdocs or xampp or anything else after the http://127.0.0.1/ except using your directory name.\nWordPress should now function just as it did on the web. You do not need to use the built-in editor in WordPress to alter your files. Just open the files directly in a text editor and edit them as you would any other file. Refreshing your browser’s web page will then show the effects.\nMoving your test WordPress site to your website\nComing soon – how to move your test site from your computer back live onto your host server site.\nResources\nTest themes on a live blog with Theme Test DriveqSandbox.com – Create a free WordPress test site to try (new) plugins and themes\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/test-driving-wordpress/", "title": "Test driving WordPress – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "There are times when you need to test changes to your WordPress-powered site out of the public eye.

{"text": "\nMust-use plugins (a.k.a. mu-plugins) are plugins installed in a special directory inside the content folder and which are automatically enabled on all sites in the installation. Must-use plugins do not show in the default list of plugins on the Plugins page of wp-admin – although they do appear in a special Must-Use section – and cannot be disabled except by removing the plugin file from the must-use directory, which is found in wp-content/mu-plugins by default.\nTo change the default directory manually, define WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR and WPMU_PLUGIN_URL in wp-config.php.\nFeatures\nAlways-on, no need to enable via admin and users cannot disable by accident.Can be enabled simply by uploading file to the mu-plugins directory, without having to log-in.Loaded by PHP, in alphabetical order, before normal plugins, meaning API hooks added in an mu-plugin apply to all other plugins even if they run hooked-functions in the global namespace.\nCaveats\nDespite its suitability for many special cases, the mu-plugins system is not always ideal and has several downsides that make it innapropriate in certain circumstances. Below are several important caveats to keep in mind:\nPlugins in the must-use directory will not appear in the update notifications nor show their update status on the plugins page, so you are responsible for learning about and performing updates on your own.Activation hooks are not executed in plugins added to the must-use plugins folder. These hooks are used by many plugins to run installation code that sets up the plugin initially and/or uninstall code that cleans up when the plugin is deleted. Plugins depending on these hooks may not function in the mu-plugins folder, and as such all plugins should be carefully tested specifically in the mu-plugins directory before being deployed to a live site.WordPress only looks for PHP files right inside the mu-plugins directory, and (unlike for normal plugins) not for files in subdirectories. You may want to create a proxy PHP loader file inside the mu-plugins directory:\n<?php // mu-plugins/load.php\nrequire WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR.'/my-plugin/my-plugin.php';\n\n\nHistory and Naming\nThe ‘mu-plugins’ directory was originally implemented by WPMU (Multi-User) to offer site admins an easy way to activate plugins by default on all blogs in the farm. There was a need for this feature because at the time the multi-user-specific code did not offer ways of achieving this effect using the site admin section (today the renamed “Multisite WordPress” has features to manage plugins from inside the admin).\nThe code handling /mu-plugins/ was merged into the main WordPress code on 03/07/09 with this changeset a full 10 months before the wpmu codebase was initially merged, and all WP sites could take advantage of autoloaded plugins, whether they had MU/Multisite enabled or not. The feature is useful for all types of WP installations depending on circumstances, so this makes sense.\nIn this process the name “mu plugins” became a misnomer because it did not apply exclusively to multisite installs and because “MU” was not even being used anymore to refer to WP installations with multiple blogs. Despite this, the name was kept and re-interpreted to mean “Must-use plugins”, i.e. These are plugins that must always be used, thus they are autoloaded on all sites regardless of the settings in the Plugins pane of wp-admin.\nThus “Must-Use” is effectively a Backronym, like PHP (which originally meant “Personal Home Page” but was later re-interpreted as meaning “PHP Hypertext Preprocessor”, which is also a Recursive Acronym).\nSource Code\nget_mu_plugins() is located in wp-admin/includes/plugin.php.wp_get_mu_plugins() is located in wp-includes/load.php.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/must-use-plugins/", "title": "Must Use Plugins – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Must-use plugins (a.k.a. mu-plugins) are plugins installed in a special directory inside the content folder and which are automatically enabled on all sites in the installation.

It has custom color options with beautiful default color schemes, a harmonious fluid grid using a mobile-first approach, and impeccable polish in every detail. Twenty Sixteen will make your WordPress look beautiful everywhere.\n\nQuick Specs\nThe main column width is up to 840px. The sidebar column width is up to 300px. The recommended Featured Image size is 1200px wide. The recommended Custom Header image size is 1200px wide and 280px height.\nNo-Sidebar Layout\nIf you’d like to keep your visitors’ focus squarely on your content, simply don’t add any widgets to the sidebar widget area. This also allows you to give your posts a powerful visual boost by adding a large Featured Image, up to 1200px wide.\n\nContent Bottom Widget Areas\nTwenty Sixteen’s two Content Bottom Widget Areas are handy spots where you can place supplementary content. On single posts and pages, these widget areas display below your content. To add widgets to them, Click Appearance > Widgets from Administration Screens and add your favorite widgets to Content Bottom 1 or Content Bottom 2 or both.\n\nPost Intro\nTwenty Sixteen has a small but nifty intro feature. Also known as a “deck” or “kicker,” the intro area is displayed between the headline and body copy. Your intro can provide important information and act as a link between the title and the rest of your post. A carefully crafted deck grabs readers’ attention, giving them an idea of what to expect in the full post. \nAdd your intro in the Screen Options. \nOverhanging Full-Size Image\nHave you ever wanted to show off your large images without sacrificing the post’s readability? On a large screen, full-size images wider than or equal to 840px overhang the column.\n\nPull Quotes\nPull quotes are a great way to refocus your readers’ attention — just add a class of alignleft or alignright to a blockquote element. Here are some examples of how to do that in the Text Editor.\n[code language=”php”]\n<blockquote class=”alignleft”>A bolder pull blockquote that aligns to the left</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=”alignright”>A bolder pull blockquote that aligns to the right</blockquote>\n[/code]\nOn a large monitor, the left-aligned pull quote overhangs the main column to maintain the readability of the text wrapped around it.\n\nCustomize\nOpen the Customizer to check out the four featured color schemes you can use to instantly change the look of your website.\n(Default)RedGrayDarkYellow\n\nPersonalize the design even further by adding a Custom Header Image or/and Site Logo.\n\nSocial Menu\nWith Twenty Sixteen, you can display links to your social media profiles with perfectly sized icons in the footer.

Twenty Nineteen is built with this in mind and includes both front-end and editor styles for all core blocks that ship with WordPress in 5.0. This means that what you see in the editor will look almost exactly like what you see on the front end.\nBlock editor\nSite Logo\nTwenty Nineteen supports a Site Logo which works great as an avatar for a personal blog or an business logo or icon. To modify it on your site, navigate to Customizer > Site Identity.\n\nCustom Colors\nTwenty Nineteen uses a blue accent color by default. That color can be customized using a color hue slider.

This can be disabled by deselecting the “Apply a filter to featured images using the site’s primary color” checkbox.

Its business-oriented design highlights new video headers, and it has a front-page layout that can be created by combining page sections. The theme can be customized further using custom color options and by adding a site logo, social menu, and widgets.\n\nQuick Specs\nThe main column width is up to 525px for the two-column layout and 740px for the one-column layout.The sidebar column width is up to 326px.The recommended size for featured images is 2000px wide by 1200px high.The recommended size for header videos and header images is 2000px wide by 1200px high.\nHeader Media\nTwenty Seventeen supports both header images and header videos. To modify either type on your site, navigate to Customizer > Header Media.\n\nFor header videos, you can upload your own mp4 video or link to a video hosted on YouTube. Smaller file sizes will help make sure your site is loaded quickly.\nA header image can be used on its own to display a large photograph at the top of your site. It can also be used as a video fallback: If both a video and image are added, the image will be used as a placeholder while the video loads, and it also acts as a fallback on smaller screens where videos may be harder to serve over mobile networks.\nFront Page\nTwenty Seventeen allows you to build a striking front page composed of content from different pages on your site. Each page’s featured image is highlighted, displayed at full-screen size with a fixed position. Twenty Seventeen has four different sections you can assign pages to.\nTo set this up, first navigate to Customizer > Static Front Page, and set your site to use a static front page if you haven’t already.\n\nNavigate to Customizer > Theme Options. Under each Front Page Section # Content header, select a page you’d like to display for that section.\n\nIf you haven’t created any pages yet, you can do that from the Customizer by clicking + Add New Page beneath any of the sections. This will allow you to create a new page from the Customizer that you can later add content to.\nFor the best appearance, make sure each page includes a featured image and some content.\nYou can also select your Blog Posts page, and the panel will display your three latest blog posts.\n\nOnce you’ve finished adding pages to the sections, click Save & Publish.\nIf you’d like to change the number of sections you can add pages to, add this snippet to your theme’s functions.php:\nadd_filter( 'twentyseventeen_front_page_sections', 'prefix_custom_front_page_sections' );function prefix_custom_front_page_sections( $num_sections ) {    return 6; }\nThis snippet changes the default four sections to six.\nCustom Colors\nTwenty Seventeen includes three color options: the default light color scheme, a dark color scheme, and a Custom Colors scheme that can be adjusted to various hues using a slider.\n\nTo explore all the color options available, navigate to Customizer > Colors.\nLanguage Support\nTwenty Seventeen includes optimal font styles for many languages, thanks to feedback from the WordPress community.

This can be changed via Customizer > Theme Options. The theme defaults to the two-column layout, which displays the page title in one column and the page content in the other.\nNote: This feature only becomes available after setting a static front page.\n\nWhen the one-column layout is selected, both the page title and content display in a wider single column, centered on the page.\n\n\nWidgets\nTwenty Seventeen includes a footer widget area allowing widgets to be added below the site’s content.\nThe blog index, archive, and search pages and single blog posts also include a sidebar widget area. For each of these pages, the content is displayed in one center column if there is no sidebar. With the sidebar, the content is displayed in one column and the widgets are displayed in the other.\nPullquotes\nPullquotes can be used to direct your readers’ attention to a particular passage or add visual interest to your posts and pages. In Twenty Seventeen, you can pair a pullquote with an alignleft or alignright class on the blockquote element to further highlight it. Instructions on how to do this can be found here. See the following example:\n<blockquote class=\"alignleft\">This is my fabulous left-aligned pullquote.</blockquote>\nWhen a two-column layout is used (whether via the Customizer for pages, or by adding a sidebar widget for posts), the pullquote aligned to the same side will display fully outside of the content area and below the second column. Note: This will only work when the pullquote appears in the content below where the second column ends.\n\nPost Formats\nTwenty Seventeen supports the following post formats:\nAsideAudioGalleryImageLinkQuoteVideo\nSocial Icons\nTwenty Seventeen includes a Social Icons Menu, allowing you to add links to your social media profiles that will be displayed as logos in the footer.

Examples of sub-directories are example.com/site1 and example.com/site2.  Sub-directories work with mod_rewrite.  \nNote: If you wish to use fully qualified domains, you still need to  pick a format to start with. Then after verifying they work, use the Domain mapping plugin.\nAlternative Messages\nSub-domain Install\nThis messages displays if you are changing from a stand-alone  version of WordPress to the multisite version this will display.Because your install is not new, the sites in your WordPress  network must use sub-domains. The main site in a sub-directory install  will need to use a modified permalink structure, potentially breaking  existing links.\nSub-directory Install\nThis messages displays if you are using localhost as a domain.Because you are using localhost, the sites in your WordPress network must use sub-directories. Consider using localhost.localdomain if you wish to use sub-domains.\nNetwork Details\nServer Address\nThe Internet address of your network will be example.com.  This information is filled in automatically.  Note:  if your existing URL has www such as www.example.com you will see this message: “We recommend you change your siteurl to example.com before enabling the network feature. It will still be possible to visit your site using the www prefix with an address like www.sample.com but any links will not have the www prefix.“\nNetwork Title\nWhat would you like to call your network?  A suggested title is supplied but edit that to reflect the title you want to use.\nAdmin E-mail Address\nYour email address.  A suggested email is supplied, but change as necessary. \nInstall\nClick the Install button to start the network install.\n\nInstallation Warnings\nYou may receive a warning about wildcard subdomains.To use a subdomain configuration, you must have a  wildcard entry in your DNS. This usually means adding a * hostname  record pointing at your web server in your DNS configuration tool.Warning! Wildcard DNS may not be configured correctly!The installer attempted to contact a random hostname  (599af5.sample.com) on your domain. This resulted in an error message:  Couldn’t resolve host ‘599af5.sample.com’ You can still use your site but any subdomain you create may not  be accessible. If you know your DNS is correct, ignore this message.\nEnabling the Network\nOnce the Network install is completed this Screen displays with these directions. Follow the directions in the order presented to complete the process. \n\nCaution We recommend you back up your existing wp-config.php and .htaccess files. \n1. Create a blogs.dir directory in /wp-content.This directory is used to stored uploaded media for your additional  sites and must be writeable by the web server.  Note that the directory  should be CHOWNed and CHMODed the same as your wp-content folder.  \nIf you’ve set the WP_CONTENT_DIR constant to something other than wp-content you may want to reconsider as you will see this message:  Warning: Networks may not be fully compatible with custom wp-content directories.\n2.  Add the following to your wp-config.php file in  /public_html/ above the line reading /* That’s all, stop editing! Happy  blogging. */   These lines are automatically generated and will look similar to this.  \ndefine( 'MULTISITE', true );\ndefine( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', true );\n$base = '/';\ndefine( 'DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE', 'sample.com' );\ndefine( 'PATH_CURRENT_SITE', '/' );\ndefine( 'SITE_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );\ndefine( 'BLOG_ID_CURRENT_SITE', 1 );\nThese unique authentication keys are also missing from your  wp-config.php file.

{"text": "\nPermalinks are the permanent URLs to your individual pages and blog posts, as well as your category and tag archives. A permalink is the web address used to link to your content. The URL to each post should be permanent and never change — hence the name permalink.\nThe Settings Permalinks Screen allows you to choose your default permalink structure. You can choose from common settings or create custom URL structures. You must click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen for the new settings to take effect.\nBy default, WordPress uses web URLs that have day and name in them; however, WordPress offers you the ability to create a custom URL structure for your permalinks and archives. This can improve the aesthetics, usability, and forward compatibility of your links.\nFor an introduction to Permalinks, read the Pretty Permalinks section of Introduction to Blogging. For a more in-depth description of the way this structure is specified, see the Using Permalinks article.\n\nCustomize Permalink structure\nA number of tags are available, and here are some examples to get you started.\nCommon settings\nCheck one of the radio buttons corresponding to the correct Permalink Structure for your blog.\n\nPlain – An example of the default structure is http://www.sample.com/?p=123\nDay and name – An example of the day and name based structure is http://www.sample.com/2008/03/31/sample-post/\nMonth and name – An example of the month and name based structure is http://www.sample.com/2008/03/sample-post/\nNumeric – An example of the numeric structure is http://www.sample.com/archives/123\nPost name – An example of the post name structure is http://www.sample.com/sample-post\nCustom structure – In the box specify the custom structure you desire to use. One example is /archives/%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/. Look at the Permalink Structure Tags.\n\nOptional\nYou may enter custom bases for your category and tag URLs here. For example, using /topics/ as your category base would make your category links like http://example.org/topics/uncategorized/. If you leave these blank the defaults will be used. Again, see the Permalink Structure Tags.\n\nCategory base – Enter a custom prefix for your category URLs here.\nTag base – Enter a custom prefix for your tag URLs here.\n\nSave Changes\nClick the Save Changes button to ensure any changes you have made to your Settings are saved to your database. Once you click the button, a confirmation text box will appear at the top of the page telling you your settings have been saved. \nAfter you’ve clicked this button, you should receive one of two messages depending on whether your .htaccess file is writeable. \n\nIf .htaccess is writeable, you will get a message that says “Permalink structure updated.” You’re all set; WordPress has been able to do everything for you automatically.\nIf .htaccess is not writeable, you will see a message at the top of the screen that says “You should update your .htaccess now.“. Near the bottom of the screen you will see “If your .htaccess file were writable, we could do this automatically, but it isn’t so these are the mod_rewrite rules you should have in your .htaccess file. Click in the field and press CTRL + a to select all.” This means you’ll have to do one extra step yourself. In the text box at the bottom of the Screen, WordPress displays several lines of rewrite rules associated with the Permalink Structure you designated above. You need to manually copy everything in this text box into your .htaccess file to make your new Permalinks work.\n\nFor information on how to make .htaccess writeable, see Changing File Permissions.\nNote: Visiting the Permalinks screen triggers a flush of rewrite rules. There is no need to save just to flush the rewrite rules.\nNote: If you’re writing your .htaccess file on your own local computer, remember, some operating systems do not allow the creation of a file named “.htaccess” because of the initial dot (“.“). You can always name the file without the initial dot or with a standard extension (e.g. “htaccess.txt“). Once the file is uploaded to your weblog’s directory, rename it with your FTP software. Most FTP Clients should provide you a way to rename files this.\nAlso Note: Files that begin with a dot (“.“) like “.htaccess” are hidden on most servers by default. Consult the user guide or FAQ of the FTP software you use to find out how to have the software display these hidden files, and also how to use the software to change file permissions, rename files, etc. For more information on all of this see Changing File Permissions.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/settings-permalinks-screen/", "title": "Settings Permalinks Screen – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Permalinks are the permanent URLs to your individual pages and blog posts, as well as your category and tag archives.

Most themes will display this title, at the top of every page, and in the reader’s browser titlebar.  WordPress also uses this title as the identifying name for your Syndication feeds.\nTagline\n In a few words, explain what your site is about. Your sites’s slogan, or tagline, might be entered here.  A tagline is short phrase, or sentence, used to convey the essence of the site and is often funny or eye-catching.\nWordPress Address (URL)\nEnter the full URL of the directory containing your WordPress core application files (e.g., wp-config.php, wp-admin, wp-content, and wp-includes). For example, if you installed WordPress into a directory called “blog”, then the WordPress address would be http://example.net/blog (where example.net is your domain). If you installed WordPress into your web root, this address will be the root URL http://example.net. WordPress will trim a slash (/) from the end.

This is the directory where WordPress’s main index.php file is installed.  The Site address (URL) is identical to the WordPress address (URL) (above) unless you are giving WordPress its own directory.  WordPress will trim a slash (/) from the end.

For example, if you allow new users to register as a member of your site (see Membership below), then a notification will be sent through e-mail to this address. In addition, if the option, An administrator must always approve the comment, is set in Administration > Settings > Discussion, this e-mail address will receive notification that the comment is being held for moderation.  Please note this is different than the address you supplied for the admin user account; the admin account e-mail address is sent an e-mail only when someone submits a comment to a post by admin.

{"text": "\nIn WordPress, there is more than one way to reset your password. (Normally, the easiest way to reset it is through the “Lost your password?” link on the main login page for your blog or website.)\nHowever, there are certain times (especially if your email isn’t working correctly) that you may have to take different steps to reset your password.\nHere’s a list of different ways to reset a password. The method that you use depends on the type of access that you still have to your website.\nTo Change Your Password\nTo change your password in current versions:\nIn the Administration Screen, menu, go to Users > All Users.Click on your username in the list to edit it.In the Edit User screen, scroll down to the New Password section and click the Generate Password button.If you want to change the automatically generated password, you can overwrite it by typing a new password in the box provided. The strength box will show you how good (strong) your password is.Click the Update User button.\n\n\n     Your new password becomes active immediately.\n\n\nThrough the automatic emailer\nIf you know your username or the email account in your profile, you can use the “lost password” feature of WordPress.\nGo to your WordPress Login page (something like http://yoursite.com/wordpress/wp-login.php)Click on the “Lost your password?” linkYou will be taken to a page to enter some details. Enter your username or the email address on file for that account.Wait happily as your new password is emailed to you.Once you get your new password, login to your profile page and change this password to something you can remember.\nThrough MySQL Command Line\nGet an MD5 hash of your password.\nVisit md5 Hash Generator, or…Create a key with Python, or…On Unix/Linux:\nCreate a file called wp.txt, containing nothing but the new password.tr -d ‘\\r\\n’ < wp.txt | md5sum | tr -d ‘ -‘rm wp.txt\nOn Mac OS X:\nCreate a file called wp.txt, containing nothing but the new password. Then enter either of the lines belowmd5 -q ./wp.txt; rm ./wp.txt (If you want the MD5 hash printed out.)md5 -q ./wp.txt | pbcopy; rm ./wp.txt (If you want the MD5 hash copied to the clipboard.)\n\n“mysql -u root -p” (log in to MySQL)enter your mysql password“use (name-of-database)” (select WordPress database)“show tables;” (you’re looking for a table name with “users” at the end)“SELECT ID, user_login, user_pass FROM (name-of-table-you-found);” (this gives you an idea of what’s going on inside)“UPDATE (name-of-table-you-found) SET user_pass=”(MD5-string-you-made)” WHERE ID = (id#-of-account-you-are-reseting-password-for);” (actually changes the password)“SELECT ID, user_login, user_pass FROM (name-of-table-you-found);” (confirm that it was changed)(type Control-D to exit mysql client)\nNote: if you have a recent version of MySQL (version 5.x?) you can have MySQL compute the MD5 hash for you.\nSkip step# 1 above.Do the following for step# 7 instead.\n“UPDATE (name-of-table-you-found) SET user_pass = MD5(‘(new-password)’) WHERE ID = (id#-of-account-you-are-reseting-password-for);” (actually changes the password)\n\nNote that even if the passwords are salted, meaning they look like $P$BLDJMdyBwegaCLE0GeDiGtC/mqXLzB0, you can still replace the password with an MD5 hash, and WordPress will let you log in.\nThrough phpMyAdmin\nThis article is for those who have phpMyAdmin access to their database. Note: use phpMyAdmin at your own risk. If you doubt your ability to use it, seek further advice. WordPress is not responsible for loss of data.\nBegin by logging into phpMyAdmin and clicking databases.A list of databases will appear. Click on your WordPress database.\nphpMyAdmin database select\nAll the tables in your database will appear. If not, click Structure.Look for wp_users in the Table column.Click on the icon for browse.Locate your username under user_loginClick edit (may look like a pencil icon in some versions of phpMyAdmin).\nphpMyAdmin select users table\nYour user_id will be shown. Click on Edit.Next to the user_pass is a long list of numbers and letters.Select and delete these and type in your new password.Type in the password you want to use. You can type it in normally–but remember, it is case-sensitive.In this example, the new password will be ‘rabbitseatcarrots.’Once you have done that, click the dropdown menu indicated, and select MD5 from the menu.\nphpMyAdmin select MD5 function on user_pass row\nCheck that your password is actually correct, and that MD5 is in the box.\nphpMyAdmin user_pass row with MD5 function and “rabbitseatcarrots” as the password\nClick the ‘Go’ button to the bottom right.Test the new password on the login screen. If it doesn’t work, check that you’ve followed these instructions exactly.\nOther Tutorials using phpMyAdmin\nReset a WordPress password from phpMyAdmin\nThrough FTP\nThere is also an easy way to reset your password via FTP, if you’re using the admin user.\nLogin to your site via FTP and download your active theme’s functions.php file.Edit the file and add this code to it, right at the beginning, after the first <?php\nwp_set_password( 'my_new_password', 1 );\n\nIn the above code, replace the text my_new_password with your own new password for the main admin user. The number 1 above refers to the user ID number in the wp_users database table. Since we wanted the user ID of the main admin user, we just keep the number as 1, which is typically the user ID of the main admin user.\nUpload the modified file back to your site.Once you are able to login, make sure to go back and remove that code. It will reset your password on every page load until you do so.\nThrough WP CLI\nWP CLI is a command line tool for managing your WordPress installation.\nMove into the /wordpress directory and type\n$ wp user list\nto see all users. Find the ID of the user you’d like to update.\nThen, update the user\n$ wp user update 1 --user_pass=$UP3RstrongP4$w0rd\nreplacing “1” with the id of the user you want to update.\nMore on wp cli\nUsing the Emergency Password Reset Script\nIf the other solutions listed above won’t work, then try the Emergency Password Reset Script. Please note that it’s not a plugin, it’s a PHP script.\nA Word of Caution:\nThe Emergency Password Reset Script requires that you know the administrator’s username.It updates the administrator password and sends an email to the administrator’s email address.Even if you don’t receive the email, the password will still be changed.You do not need to be logged in to use it. (After all, if you could login, you wouldn’t need the script.)Place the script in the root of your WordPress installation. Do not upload it to your WordPress Plugins directory.For security reasons, remember to delete the script when you are done.\nDirections for Use:\nCopy the emergency script from Emergency Password Script and put into a file called emergency.php in the root of your WordPress installation (the same directory that contains wp-config.php).In your browser, open http://example.com/emergency.php.As instructed, enter the administrator username (usually admin) and the new password, then click Update Options. A message is displayed noting the changed password. An email is sent to the blog administrator with the changed password information.Delete emergency.php from your server when you are done. Do not leave it on your server, as someone else could use it to change your password.\nAdditional Reference\nHere is another password reset script that can be used without knowing the username or email.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reset-your-password/", "title": "Reset Your Password – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "In WordPress, there is more than one way to reset your password.

You may be interested in user documentation for the new block editor.\n\nPosts are entries that display in reverse order on your home page and/or blog page. Posts usually have comment fields beneath them and are included in your site’s RSS feed.\nTo write a post:\n\nLog in to your WordPress Administration Screen (Dashboard).\nClick the ‘Posts’ tab.\nClick the ‘Add New’ sub-tab.\nStart filling in the blanks: enter your post title in the upper field, and enter your post body content in the main post editing box below it.\nAs needed, select a category, add tags, and make other selections from the sections below the post. (Each of these sections is explained below.)\nWhen you are ready, click Publish.\n\nScreen Options\nThere are more editing fields available to you than you see on first login. The Screen Options area allows you to choose which Post Fields are displayed or hidden from your editing area, which allows you to minimize clutter and customize according to your needs.\nYou’ll find the Screen Options tab at the very top of your screen, and if you click on it, you’ll see a list of available editing boxes that you can use. Check the box for each Post Field you want displayed, or uncheck the box to hide that module. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the tab.\nOnce you’ve customized how editing screen, your options are saved so you don’t have to select or hide them again next time you log in.\nPost Field Descriptions\n\nClassic Editor – Top of Page\nTitle/Headline Box\nThis box should contain the title of your post. You can use any phrase, words, or characters. (Avoid using the same title on more than one page.) You can use commas, apostrophes, quotes, hyphens/dashes, and other typical symbols in the post like “My Site – Here’s Lookin’ at You, Kid.” WordPress will then clean it up to generate a user-friendly and URL-valid name of the post (also called the “post slug”) to create the permalink for the post.\nPermalink\nPermalink stands for “permanent link.” That means a post URL that does not expose the post ID which could be subject to a change (e.g. when moving to different blogging system), but it rather contains a user-friendly post name derived from the post title which could also change, although not recommended, but in a more controllable way. This post name (also referred to as “post slug” or just “slug”) can be edited, depending on your Permalinks settings, using the “Edit” button. (To change your settings, go to Administration Screens > Settings > Permalinks). The permalink is automatically generated based on the title you set to the post and is shown below the title field. Punctuation such as commas, quotes, apostrophes, and invalid URL characters are removed and spaces are substituted with dashes to separate each word. If your title is “My Site – Here’s Lookin’ at You, Kid”, it will be cleaned up to create the slug “my-site-heres-lookin-at-you-kid”. You can manually change this, maybe shortening it to “my-site-lookin-at-you-kid”.\nBody Copy Box\nThe blank box where you enter your writing, links, images, links to images, and any information you want to display on your site.

Draft means the post has not been published and remains in draft status for the post creator. A Published status means the post has been published and is live on your site.\nPreview Button Allows you to view the post before publishing.\nSave Draft Allows you to save your post as a draft rather than immediately publishing it. To return to your drafts later, visit Posts – Edit in the menu bar, then select your post from the list.\nStatus If you select a specific publish status (click Edit next to Status:Draft) and click the update post or “Publish” button, that status is applied to the post. For example, to save a post in the Pending Review status, select Pending Review from the Publish Status drop-down box, and click Save As Pending. (You will see all posts organized by status by going to Administration Screens > Posts > Edit).\nVisibility This determines how your post appears to the world. (click Edit next to Visibility) Public posts will be visible by all website visitors once published. Password Protected posts are published to all, but visitors must know the password to view the post content. Private posts are visible only to you (and to other editors or admins within your site).\nRevisions Click Browse to see all of the changes you’ve made to your post.\nScheduling To schedule a post for publication on a future time or date, click Edit next to the words “Publish immediately.” You can also change the publish date to a date in the past to back-date posts. Change the settings to the desired time and date. You must also click the Publish button when you have completed the post to publish at the desired time and date.\nFormat Box \nAllows you to choose a format for a post. Styling and appearance are handled by the individual themes.\nCategories Box\nThe general topic of the post. It is typical for a blog to have 7-10 categories for content. Readers can browse specific categories to see all posts in the category. You can manage your categories by going to Administration Screens > Posts > Categories.\nTags Box\nThese are micro-categories for the post, similar to including index entries for a page. Posts with similar tags are linked together when a user clicks one of the tags. Tags have to be enabled with the right code in your theme for them to appear in your post. Add new tags to the post by typing the tag into the box and clicking “Add.” You can also click on the “Choose from the most-used tags” link to see all of the tags used by the site.\nExcerpt\nA summary or brief teaser of your post that may appear on the front page of your site as well as on the category, archives, and search non-single post pages. Note: the Excerpt does not usually appear by default. It only appears in your post if you have modified the template file listing the post to use the_excerpt() instead of the_content() to display the Excerpt instead of the full content of a post. If so, WordPress will automatically use as the Excerpt the first 55 words of your post content or the content before the <!–more–> quicktag. If you use the “Excerpt” field when editing the post, this will be used no matter what. For more information, see Excerpt.\nSend Trackbacks\nA way to notify legacy blog systems that you’ve linked to them. If you link other WordPress blogs, they’ll be notified automatically using pingbacks. No other action is necessary. For those blogs that don’t recognize pingbacks, you can send a trackback to the blog by entering the website address(es) in this box, separating each one by a space. See Trackbacks and Pingbacks for more information.\nCustom Fields\nCustom Fields offer a way to add information to your site. In conjunction with extra code in your template files or plugins, Custom Fields can modify the way a post is displayed. These are primarily used by plugins, but you can manually edit that information in this section.\nDiscussion\nOptions to enable interactivity and notification of your posts. This section hosts two check boxes: Allow Comments on this post and Allow trackbacks and pingbacks on this post. If Allowing Comments is unchecked, no one can post comments to this particular post. If Allowing Pings is unchecked, no one can post pingbacks or trackbacks to this particular post.\nPost Author\nA list of all blog authors you can select from to attribute as the post author. This section only shows if you have multiple users with authoring rights in your blog. To view your list of users, see Administration Screens > Users. For more information, see Users and Authors.\n\nClassic Editor – Bottom of Page\nNote: You can set basic options for writing, such as the size of the post box, how smiley tags are converted, and other details by going to Administration Screens > Settings > Writing.\nBest Practices For Posting\nYou can say or show the world anything you like on your WordPress site. Here are some tips you need to know to help you write your posts in WordPress.\nPractice Accessibility\nTo be compliant with web standards for accessibility, be sure to include ALT and TITLE descriptions on links and images to help your users, such as <a title=”WordPress.ORG” href=”https://wordpress.org/“>WordPress.ORG</a>.\nUse Paragraphs\nNo one likes to read writing that never pauses for a line break. To break your writing up into paragraphs, use double spaces between your paragraphs. WordPress will automatically detect these and insert <p> HTML paragraph tags into your writing.\nUse Headings\nIf you are writing long posts, break up the sections by using headings, small titles to highlight a change of subject. In HTML, headings are set by the use of h1, h2, h3, h4, and so on.\nUse HTML\nYou don’t have to use HTML when writing your posts. WordPress will automatically add it to your site, but if you do want control over different elements like boxes, headings, and other additional containers or elements, use HTML.\nSpell Check and Proofread\nThere are spell check Plugins available, but even those can’t check for everything. Some serious writers will write their posts in a text editor with spell check, check all the spelling and proof it thoroughly before copying and pasting into WordPress.\nVisual Versus Text Editor\nWhen writing your post, you have the option of using the Visual or Text mode of the editor. The visual mode lets you see your post as is, while the Text mode shows you the code and replaces the WYSIWYG editor buttons with quicktags. These quicktags are explained as follows.\n\nb – <strong></strong> HTML tag for strong emphasis of text (i.e. bold).\ni – <em></em> HTML tag for emphasis of text (i.e. italicize).\nb-quote – <blockquote></blockquote> HTML tag to distinguish quoted or cited text.\ndel – <del></del> HTML tag to label text considered deleted from a post. Most browsers display as striked through text.\nlink – <a href=\"http://example.com\"></a> HTML tag to create a hyperlink.\nins – <ins></ins> HTML tag to label text considered inserted into a post. Most browsers display as underlined text.\nul – <ul></ul> HTML tag will insert an unordered list, or wrap the selected text in same. An unordered list will typically be a bulleted list of items.\nol – <ol></ol> HTML tag will insert a numbered list, or wrap the selected text in same. Each item in an ordered list is typically numbered.\nli – <li></li> HTML tag will insert or make the selected text a list item. Used in conjunction with the ul or ol tag.\ncode – <code></code> HTML tag for preformatted styling of text. Generally sets text in a monospaced font, such as Courier.\nmore – <!--more--> WordPress tag that breaks a post into “teaser” and content sections. Type a few paragraphs, insert this tag, then compose the rest of your post. On your blog’s home page you’ll see only those first paragraphs with a hyperlink ((more...)), which when followed displays the rest of the post’s content.\npage – <!--nextpage--> WordPress tag similar to the more tag, except it can be used any number of times in a post, and each insert will “break” and paginate the post at that location. Hyperlinks to the paginated sections of the post are then generated in combination with the wp_link_pages() or link_pages() template tag.\nlookup – Opens a JavaScript dialogue box that prompts for a word to search for through the online dictionary at answers.com. You can use this to check spelling on individual words.\nClose Tags – Closes any open HTML tags left open–but pay attention to the closing tags. WordPress is not a mind reader (!), so make sure the tags enclose what you want, and in the proper way.\n\nWorkflow Note – With Quicktag buttons that insert HTML tags, you can for example click i to insert the opening <em> tag, type the text to be enclosed, and click /i or Close Tags to insert the closing tag. However, you can eliminate the need for this ‘close’ step by changing your workflow a bit: type your text, select the portion to be emphasized (that is, italicized), then click i and your highlighted text will be wrapped in the opening and closing tags.\nMore Information and Resources\n\n About Weblogs – What is Blogging all about?\nFirst Steps With WordPress\n\nSee also Administration Screens.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/write-posts-classic-editor/", "title": "Write Posts (Classic Editor) – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Note: In December 2018, WordPress 5.0 launched with a new editor.

It is here the administrator decides if comments are allowed, if pingbacks and trackbacks are acceptable, and what constitutes Comment Spam. On this Screen you also control the circumstances under which your blog sends you e-mail notification of certain events at your site.\n\nDiscussion Settings\nDefault article Setting\nThese settings may be overridden for individual articles.\nAttempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article – If you check this box, WordPress will send out a ping to a site or article you have linked to in your post. Your mention of their site or article will show up in the comment section of their site, if that site allows pingbacks. The notification occurs during the process of publishing your article to the internet. An article with many hyperlinks will slow the posting process as WordPress contacts all of the sites before the post is published.Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) – Check this box so WordPress to accepts or declines the pings from other sites which may reference your site or an article on your site. If this box is checked, pingbacks and trackbacks will appear in the comments section of your posts.Allow people to post comments on new articles – Check this box if you wish to allow comments to your posts. Remember that this can be overridden for individual articles. Comments can also be controlled by making an article PRIVATE, which requires the appropriate password before a comment is allowed. If you don’t wish to allow comments uncheck this setting.\nOther comment settings\nComment author must fill out name and e-mail – Check this box as a way to force spammers to do a bit of extra work. In reality, the name and e-mail address are not verified in any way prior to the comment being submitted. Most legitimate commenters are more than willing to fill out a name and e-mail address.Users must be registered and logged in to comment – If this checkbox is checked, only logged in registered users will be able to write comments on your site.Automatically close comments on articles older than [X] days – Check the box and enter the number of days (e.g. 14 days) after which WordPress will automatically flag eligible posts so that no more comments are accepted.Enable threaded (nested) comments [X] levels deep – Check this box to enable threaded comments, then from the drop-down box, select the number of levels deep (maximum of 10 levels) you will allow for nested comments. Note that themes need to be specially coded to properly display threaded comments.Break comments into pages with [X] top level comments per page and the [last/first] page displayed by default. Comments should be displayed with the [older/newer] comments at the top of each page – Check this box to cause comments to display in a paginated format with the specified number of comments per page. In addition, specify if the pages should be ordered “first to last” or “last to first”, and within each page, whether the oldest, or newest, comment is to be displayed first.\nEmail me whenever\nThese two settings give you control of when authors and administrators receive notification that comments have been made, or that comments are held for moderation. Please note that the use of “me” refers to either a post author or the administrator (person whose email address is used for admin purposes).\nAnyone posts a comment – Check this box so that every single comment posted will generate an email to the author of that post. Be warned that if your posts receive a large number of comments, post authors may find a very full email Inbox. If you wish to micromanage comments, then by all means, activate this setting by checking the box.A comment is held for moderation – Check this box if you want WordPress to send notification that a comment is being held for moderation. The email notification is sent to the E-mail address listed in the Administration > Settings > General Screen. This is useful if your blog has multiple authors and each author is authorized to allow or decline comments. That way, you, the owner of the site, can review what comments are being allowed or denied.\nBefore a comment appears\nThese settings provide you even more control over the instances of when and how comments are posted.\nAn administrator must always approve the comment – Select this option to force comments to be approved by a blog user or owner having the proper Role to approve comments, even if the comments appear to be spam . See the Comment Moderation options below regarding spam.Comment author must have a previously approved comment – Check the box to insure comments are only posted if the comment author’s email address matches the address of a previously approved comment, otherwise, the comment is held for moderation. Comments from blocked email addresses (those listed in the Local Spam Words Text Box) are held for moderation regardless of whitelist status.\nComment Moderation\nIn the Comment Moderation section you specify these options to help you deal with Comment Spam.\nHold a comment in the queue if it contains [X] or more links (A common characteristic of comment spam is a large number of hyperlinks.) – Not too long ago, comment spammers would have five, ten, or more hyperlinks in their comment spam. This made it very easy for bloggers to quickly screen comments but spammers recognized that and commonly use only one or two hyperlinks. You can enter a number in this box to tell WordPress how many links you allow in a comment before holding it for moderation.When a comment contains any of these words in its content, name, URL, e-mail, IP or browser’s user-agent string it will be held in the moderation queue. One word or IP per line. It will match inside words, so “press” will match “WordPress” – In this text box you can add your own spam words which will filter the comments when posted.\nComment Blocklist\nPrevious to WordPress version 5.4, this was named “Comment Blacklist”.\nWhen a comment contains any of these words in its content, author name, URL, e-mail, IP address or browser’s user-agent string, it will be marked as spam. One word or IP per line. It will match inside words, so “press” will match “WordPress”. This text box acts the same as “When a comment conatins any of these words…” except comments which match these words will be deleted without warning.

{"text": "\nWhether you write plugins or hacks for WordPress, or you want to add bits and pieces of code about your own WordPress site or other programming code like HTML, CSS, PHP, or JavaScript, putting code in your post that looks like code, but doesn’t behave like code, is a frequent challenge for bloggers.\nBy default, the way a piece of code written or pasted to WordPress post editor is interpreted depends on whether you use visual or HTML post editor. Visual editor will consider the code to be an ordinary text, converting (encoding) the < and > characters into their < and > character entity equivalents, so that the code is not interpreted by a web browser. Quotes are converted too, but remember that by default, WordPress also applies auto-correction so that the text is quoted properly according to your language specifics. HTML editor does not convert any of these characters, so be aware that HTML and CSS markup you use in your code examples will be recognized by a web browser and you may end up with a funky looking text and a messed up layout.\nNote that this behavior may differ with respect to the WordPress version, post editor and other plugins used. In some older versions of WordPress, unrecognized uses of the < and > characters were converted into the &lt; and &gt; character entities, and when an HTML tag was found within the post, the tag was left as it was, allowing for its interpretation in a web browser.\nCode Within Paragraphs\nThe HTML tag which will turn text into a monospaced font. They are <code> and <tt>. The latter is rarely used today, replaced by the more useful and semantically correct <code>, which distinguishes text that is computer code from natural language.\nThis is an example which mentions code within a paragraph,namely the functions <code>wp_title()</code>, <code>wp_content()</code> and <code>wp_footer()</code>, which are very useful in WordPress.\nThis is great for making a piece of non-HTML text look like code, but what about HTML tags that you want to showcase?\nIn the header.php template file,look for the <code><div class=\"header\"></code>section to change the <code><h1></code> heading.\nUsing the <code> tag doesn’t tell WordPress to encode HTML markup within the tag or strip it from the post. WordPress thinks that you are using this markup for formatting, leaving it untouched. A web browser then sees a <code> tag followed by a <div> tag and so it responds by creating a new container in your web page. \nTo avoid this behavior, use character entities or extended characters to represent the left and right arrow characters in a way that is not recognized as the beginning and end of an HTML tag by a web browser, like this:\nIn the header.php template file,look for the <code>&lt;div class=\"header\"&gt;</code>section to change the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> heading.\nURLs Within Paragraphs\nBy default, WordPress will turn any phrase that begins with http: into a link. If you are giving an example of how to link to a specific post within a WordPress site, instead of using the link with http://example.com/index.php?p=453 and having it turn into a link, you can use extended characters for the slashes, so WordPress won’t “see” the link:\n...link to a specific WordPress post using <code>http:& amp;#47;& amp;#47;example.com& amp;#47;index.php?p=453</code>in your post....\nNote: Take off Space between ‘&’ and ‘amp’.\nList of Related Character Entities\nHere is a list of some HTML character entities related to the topic of this article:\n[code](less than) = < or <\n(greater than) = > or >\n/ = /\n] = ]\n[ = [\n” = \" or \"\n‘ = '\n“ = “ or “\n” = ” or “\n‘ = ‘ or ‘\n’ = ’ or ’\n(ampersand) = & or &[/code]\nThere is a list of resources below which will help you turn HTML tags into character entities automatically, so you don’t have to memorize these character codes.\nUsing the <pre> tag\nTo set your code aside so that it looks like a box of code which may be copied and pasted within other code or template file, you can use the <pre> HTML tag.\nThe <pre> tag instructs the browser to use a monospaced font, but to exactly reproduce whatever is inside of the <pre>tags. Every space, line break, every bit of code is exactly reproduced.\n<h3>Section Three Title</h3><p>This is the start of a <a title=\"article on relationships\" href=\"goodtalk.php\">good relationship</a> between you and me....\nUsing the <pre> tag isn’t very “pretty” but it does the job. Examples of how to style it can be found in the next section. Still, it showcases the code exactly.\nBy exactly, we mean EXACTLY. If you have a long line of code, it will run off the page because there are no instructionswhich tell the code to wrap. It won’t. Here is an example:\n<h3>Section Three Title</h3><p>This is the start of a <a title=\"article on relationships\"href=\"goodtalk.php\">good relationship</a> between you and I and I think you should read it because it isimportant that we have these little <a title=\"article on communication\"href=\"communication.php\">conversations</a> once in a while to let each other know how we feel....\nNot pretty, is it. To avoid this screen run-off, put in line breaks. Unfortunately, deciding where to put those line breaks in when you are showcasing code that will be copied makes it a difficult decision.\nIf you are familiar with programming language, you will know when a line break won’t mess up a line of code, so choose there. If you are unfamiliar with where to put line breaks, experiment. Put the code in, make the line breaks, and then test the code. If it works, then use the line break there. If not, change the line break position.\nIf you have long lines of code, consider showcasing only excerpts and providing a link to the full code placed on your site in a text or PHP file, or using one of the many online pastebins which are available for temporarily showcasing code.\nTroubleshooting Codes\nWriting code within a WordPress post can be a challenge, maybe forcing you to override the WordPress default styles and to use filters which “fix” what we write. If you are having trouble with writing code within your WordPress post, this section might help.\nQuotes Auto-correction\nA frequent problem when using codes within your post is the quotes auto-correction feature of WordPress, mostly known from word processing software. By default, when serving a web page, WordPress converts the “straight“ quotes into the opening and closing “curly” quotation marks according to your WordPress installation language set in the wp-config.php file. Note that the auto-correction (also called smart quotes) feature is applied regardless of whether you have written the quotes in visual or HTML post editor.\nIn HTML post editor, you can avoid this problem by wrapping the quotes with the <code>, <tt> or <pre> tags. Other solution is replacing quotes with their respective character entities, e.g. using:\n<code><p class=& #34;red& #34;></code>    // Take off space between & and #\ninstead of:\n<p class=\"red\">\nNote that in some older versions of WordPress, if you edited a page again after publishing it, the HTML editor replaced all these entities with their literal equivalents. For example, if you carefully used &#34 for your quotes, they would have come back as “, and if saved, the auto-correction feature would have an effect on them.\nResources\nFun Character Entities\nFrequent Code User\nIf you consistently use a lot of formulas, functions, and programming code in your posts, consider using a plugin or PHP tool to make the entire process easier. If you tend to post a LOT of code blocks, consider pasting the code in a Paste Bin and linking to it on your site.\nFigureRender – LaTeX rendering plugin9 Syntax Highlighter Plugins and Services for Embedding Code Snippets in WordPress – Following are list of best WordPress plugins or 3rd-party services to highlight code snippets within your blog that I have personally tried in 2013.Coffee2code’s Preserve Code Formatting WordPress PluginQuickCode WordPress Plugin – Hides/unhides formatted blocks of code.Using ASCIIMathLaTex – A document preparation systemUsing LaTeX in WordPressDisplay mathematical equations within your postsHow to Build Dean Lee’s Plugin – A plugin for GeSHi – Generic Syntax HighlighterVisual Code Editor Plugin – Modifies WordPress’s behavior so that code format is preserved when using the visual editor.

{"text": "\nIntroduction to Feeds\nA feed is a function of special software that allows feedreaders to access a site, automatically looking for new content and then posting the information about new content and updates to another site. This provides a way for users to keep up with the latest and hottest information posted on different blogging sites.\nThere are several different kinds of feeds, read by different feedreaders. Some feeds include RSS (alternately defined as “Rich Site Summary” or “Really Simple Syndication”), Atom or RDF files.\nWordPress Built-in Feeds\nBy default, WordPress comes with various feeds. They are generated by template tag for bloginfo() for each type of feed and are typically listed in the sidebar and/or footer of most WordPress Themes. They look like this:\nURL for RDF/RSS 1.0 feed \n<?php bloginfo('rdf_url'); ?>\nURL for RSS 0.92 feed \n<?php bloginfo('rss_url'); ?>\nURL for RSS 2.0 feed \n<?php bloginfo('rss2_url'); ?>\nURL for Atom feed \n<?php bloginfo('atom_url'); ?>\nURL for comments RSS 2.0 feed \n<?php bloginfo('comments_rss2_url'); ?>\nThe first four feeds display recent updates and changes to your site’s content for the different feedreaders. Of these, the RSS feeds are the most well known. The last feed example is used by RSS 2.0 feedreaders and does not show your site’s content. It only shows the comments made on your site.\nTo track the comments on a specific post, the post_comments_feed_link() template tag is used on single post pages like this:\n<?php post_comments_feed_link('RSS 2.0'); ?>\n\nThere are ways to modify these feeds, and these are covered in the article on Customizing Feeds.\nFinding Your Feed URL\nThere are times when you want to tell someone your site’s feed address or URL, or you need it to submit it to search engines and directories, many of which now accept feed URL submissions. There are four possible URLs for each of your feeds. Any of these will work.\nhttp://example.com/?feed=rss\nhttp://example.com/?feed=rss2\nhttp://example.com/?feed=rdf\nhttp://example.com/?feed=atom\nIf you are using custom permalinks, you should be able to reach them through this usage:\nhttp://example.com/feed/\nhttp://example.com/feed/rss/\nhttp://example.com/feed/rss2/\nhttp://example.com/feed/rdf/\nhttp://example.com/feed/atom/\nComments\nYour site has feeds for all comments on the site, and each post has its own comment feed.\nSite comment feed\nPermalink format:\nhttp://example.com/comments/feed/\nDefault format:\nhttp://example.com/?feed=comments-rss2\nPost-specific comment feed\nPermalink format:\nhttp://example.com/post-name/feed/\nDefault format:\nhttp://example.com/?p=33&feed=rss2\nCategories and Tags\nYou can also provide feeds to only specific categories or tags on your site by adding the following to the end of the link:\nhttp://www.example.com/?cat=42&feed=rss2http://www.example.com/?tag=tagname&feed=rss2http://www.example.com/category/categoryname/feedhttp://www.example.com/tag/tagname/feed\nYou can include posts from one of multiple categories or tags in a feed by comma-separating their values. For example:\nhttp://www.example.com/?cat=42,43&feed=rss2http://www.example.com/?tag=tag1,tag2&feed=rss2http://www.example.com/category/cat1,cat2/feed\nYou can include posts from all of multiple categories or tags in a feed by adding to the end of the link. For example:\nhttp://www.example.com/category/cat1+cat2/feed\nhttp://www.example.com/tag/tag1+tag2/feed\nYou can exclude categories from the feed by using something like this:\nhttp://www.example.com/?cat=-123&feed=rss2\n\nOlder versions of WordPress used a format such as but this has been deprecated in newer versions.\nhttp://example.com/wp-rss2.php?cat=42\nAuthors\nEvery author has an RSS feed for their posts. Here is the format:\nhttp://example.com/author/authorname/feed/\nSearch\nSearch results can also have their own feed. Here is the format:\nhttp://example.com/?s=searchterm&feed=rss2\nAdding Feeds\nNot all WordPress Themes feature all of the RSS Feed types that are available through WordPress. To add a feed to your site, find the location of where the other feeds are, typically in your sidebar.php or footer.php template files of your Theme. Then add one of the tags listed above to the list, like this example:\n<ul class=\"feeds\">\n    <li><a href=\"<?php bloginfo('rss2_url'); ?>\" title=\"<?php _e('Syndicate this site using RSS'); ?>\"><?php _e('<abbr title=\"Really Simple Syndication\">RSS</abbr>'); ?></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"<?php bloginfo('atom_url'); ?>\" title=\"<?php _e('Syndicate this site using Atom'); ?>\"><?php _e('Atom'); ?></a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"<?php bloginfo('comments_rss2_url'); ?>\" title=\"<?php _e('The latest comments to all posts in RSS'); ?>\"><?php _e('Comments <abbr title=\"Really Simple Syndication\">RSS</abbr>'); ?></a></li>\n</ul>\n\nAdding Graphics to Feed Links\nMany people like to have a graphic representing the feed instead of words. There are now standards for these graphics or “buttons”, but you can make your own to match the look and colors on your site.  \nTo add a graphic to your feed link, simply wrap the link around the graphic such as:\n<a href=\"<?php bloginfo('rss2_url'); ?>\" title=\"<?php _e('Syndicate this site using RSS'); ?>\"><img src=\"http://www.mozilla.org/images/feed-icon-14x14.png\" alt=\"RSS Feed\" title=\"RSS Feed\" /></a>\n\nChanging Addresses\nIf you are currently using other webblog software and are changing to WordPress, or are moving your weblog to a new location, you can “forward” RSS readers to your new RSS feeds using file rewrites and redirects in your .htaccess file.\nEdit the .htaccess file in your root folder; if no file exists, create one.\nHere is an example for a b2 feed:\nRewriteRule ^b2rss2.php(.*)? /wordpress/?feed=rss2 [QSA]\n\nHere is an example for MovableType Users:\nRewriteRule ^index.xml(.*)? /wordpress/?feed=rss2 [QSA]\n\nFeed Director provides rewrite rules for common feed filenames used by other blogging platforms, such as index.xml, index.rdf, rss.xml, rss2.xml, atom.xml, *.xml, via an easy-to-use “install it and forget it” plugin.\nRSS feed time and date format\nWordPress adheres to the RSS specifications. This means that the time and date format will NOT use your blog time/date format as set in your settings, instead it uses the time and date format from the RFC822 specification. This looks for example like this: Sun, 06 Sep 2009 16:10:34 +0000\nNote: The time/date format of feed should NOT be localized since the the current RSS specifications are referring to RFC822 specification which specifies English as a default. This implies that every RSS consumer should take care of translating time/date according to its locale.\nFeed Errors in Browsers\nA feed is a stream of data meant to be interpreted by a feed reader, like NewsBlur or RSSOwl.\nAs of 2019, no major browsers have the ability to display feeds without third-party add-ons or extensions. Users of these browsers will notice a “This XML file does not appear to have any style information associated with it. The document tree is shown below.” error followed by the raw feed, or a more helpful notice that a feed reader add-on or extension must be installed.\nMore Information and Resources\nCustomizing FeedsHow to setup and create category RSS feedsComplete reference for determining your various WordPress feed URLsHow to add an image to your RSS feed in WordPress 2.0 and aboveWork with RSS in WordPress siteHow to add images to RSS and Atom feedsAdd RSS feed link icons to WordPress categoriesUsing FeedBurner with WordPressChanging feed url with .htaccessRedirect WordPress Feeds to Feedburner without a pluginFeed Icons provides official RSS icons in many formats (AI, EPS, SVG, PSD, PDF, PNG, JPG, GIF).WP RSS Aggregator an RSS aggregator/import plugin for WordPressWikipedia – RSS an overview on RSS\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-feeds/", "title": "WordPress Feeds – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Introduction to Feeds A feed is a function of special software that allows feedreaders to access a site, automatically looking for new content and then posting the information about new content and updates to another site.

{"text": "\nEvery post in WordPress can be filed under one or more Tags. This\naids in navigation and allows posts and to be grouped with others of\nsimilar content.\n\nUnlike Categories, Tags have no hierarchy so there is no\nParent->Child relationship like that of Categories.  But like\nCategories, Tag names must be unique.\n\nAssuming you are using the WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme,  Tags are displayed under each post.  When someone viewing your blog  clicks on one of these Tag links, a Tag archive page with all the posts  belonging to that Tag, will be displayed.  In addition, if using  Widgets, the Tag Cloud Widget can be added to the sidebar to display all  the Tags used in a cloud (Tags sized by number of times reference in  posts).  \nPosts Tag Screen\nThis Screen allows you to create new Tags, and to edit or delete existing ones. \nManage Tags\nThis Screen is divided into the Popular Tags, Add New Tag and Tag Table sections.\n\nPopular Tags\nIn this section, a Tag Cloud displays the forty-five (45) most\npopular Tags–meaning the Tags that are most used on posts.  With the\nproper capability, each Tag can be clicked to edit that Tag.  Of course,\n if no Tags have been assigned to posts, then this section will not\nappear.\n\nAdd New Tag\nThis part of the Screen, which is conveniently linked to from the top of the Table of Tags,  allows you to create a new Tag.  There are three pieces of information  associated with each new Tag:  the name, description, slug, and number  of posts containing that Tag.\nTag Name:  To reiterate, the Tag Name must be unique. \nTag Slug: The Tag slug must be unique. The “slug” is the URL-friendly  version of the name. It is usually all lowercase and contains only  letters, numbers, and hyphens. For example, setting a Tag Name of  “Recipes” and a Tag Slug of “food” would show all “Recipes” posts with a  URL like example.com/blog/food/.\nDescription: A description for the Tag.  Note:  In many themes the Tag Description not displayed, however some themes may show it.\nAdd New Tag: Click this button to save your new Tag. \nTable of Tags\nThis table lists all of your Tags by row.  Tags are displayed alphabetically by Tag Name.\n\nThe table of Tags contains the following columns:\n\n[ ] – A checkbox that when clicked (checked), ‘selects’ that particular Tag to be deleted when the Delete Action is Applied. Name – The name of the Tag.  Remember each Name must be unique.  Click on the Tag’s Name to edit the Tag.Description – The description of the Tag.  Slug – The slug of a Tag, and must be unique.Count – The number of posts which have this Tag assigned. Click on the number in the Count column to be directed to the Posts Screen to manage the Posts in that Tag.\nScreen Options\nThe Screen Options  allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in  the underlying Table.  Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list  of the columns with a check-box next to each column.  Check the box for  each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not  display that column.  In addition, the number of Tags to display in the Table of Tags can be set.  Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options. \nSearch\nAbove the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a\nword, or series of words, and click the “Search Tags” button to search\nand display all the Tags meeting your search words.\n\nUsing Selection, Actions, and Apply\nSelection\n\nThis section allows Actions to be performed on one or more Tags\ndisplayed in the Table.  For Actions to be performed on multiple Tags at\n once, those Tags must be first selected via one of these methods:\n\nSelect one Tag at a time – To select a Tag, the checkbox\nto the left of the Tag entry must be checked (clicked).  It is possible\nto keep selecting more Tags by checking their respective checkbox.Select all Tags in given Table – All Tags in a given table\ncan be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table’s title, or footer\n bar.  Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar checkbox\nwill cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT selected). Reverse Selection – A Reverse Selection means checked items\nbecome unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse\nSelection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and\nclicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.\nActions\n\nActions describe the process to be performed on particular Tags.  There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as Bulk Actions and Immediate Actions.  The follow describes these Actions:\n\nBulk Actions – These Actions can be performed on one, or more Tags, at one time, if those Tags have been previously selected.  Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Actions  pulldown box, above each Table.  The only Bulk Action allowed is  Delete.   Immediate Actions – Immediate Actions are performed  immediately, on an individual Tag.  Hovering the mouse cursor over the  Tag row reveals the Edit, Quick Edit, and Delete options under the Name  column in that Tag row.  Clicking on a Tag Name will also initiate the  Edit Action.\n\nThe available Actions are described below:\n\nEdit – This Immediate Action displays the Edit Tag Screen  to edit the Tag fields.  This Action can be initiated by click on the  Tag Name or clicking on the Edit option just below the Tag Name.  See  the Edit Tag section for details on editing a Tag.Quick Edit – This Immediate Action initiates the Quick Edit of that Tag.  See the Quick Edit section for details doing a Quick Edit on a Tag. Delete – This Action deletes the Tags files. Note: Deleting a Tag does not delete the posts in that Tag.\nApply\n\nAfter one or more Tags are selected, and after a Bulk Action is specified, the Apply button performs the given Action on the selected Tags.\n\nApply – Click the Apply button to execute the  Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pull-down, on the selected Tags.   Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Tags must be selected, as described before.\nQuick Edit\n  The following fields can be change via the Quick Edit Action: \nTag name:  The Tag name must be unique. \nTag slug:  The Tag slug must be unique.  Cancel:  Click this button to cancel any changes and return to the Table of Tags \nUpdate Tag:  Once you’ve edited all the information about the Tag, use this button to save the changes. \nEdit Tag\nThis Screen is displayed by clicking on a Tags’ Name in the Table of Tags  or clicking on the Edit option just below the Tag Name. It is possible  to edit three pieces of information associated with each Tag:  the  name, the slug, and the description.\nTag name: The Tag name must be unique. \nTag Slug:  The Tag slug must be unique.\nDescription: Text describing this Tag. \nUpdate:   Once you’ve changed the Tag information, use this button to save the changes.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/posts-tags-screen/", "title": "Posts Tags Screen – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Every post in WordPress can be filed under one or more Tags.

{"text": "\nDebugging PHP code is part of any project, but WordPress comes with specific debug systems designed to simplify the process as well as standardize code across the core, plugins and themes. This page describes the various debugging tools in WordPress and how to be more productive in your coding as well as increasing the overall quality and interoperativity of your code.\nFor non-programmers or general users, these options can be used to show detailed information about errors.\nExample wp-config.php for Debugging\nThe following code, inserted in your wp-config.php file, will log all errors, notices, and warnings to a file called debug.log in the wp-content directory. It will also hide the errors so they do not interrupt page generation.\n// Enable WP_DEBUG mode\ndefine( 'WP_DEBUG', true );\n\n// Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file\ndefine( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );\n\n// Disable display of errors and warnings\ndefine( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );\n@ini_set( 'display_errors', 0 );\n\n// Use dev versions of core JS and CSS files (only needed if you are modifying these core files)\ndefine( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );\nNOTE: You must insert this BEFORE /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */ in the wp-config.php file. \nWP_DEBUG\nWP_DEBUG is a PHP constant (a permanent global variable) that can be used to trigger the “debug” mode throughout WordPress. It is assumed to be false by default and is usually set to true in the wp-config.php file on development copies of WordPress.\n// This enables debugging.\ndefine( 'WP_DEBUG', true );\n// This disables debugging.\ndefine( 'WP_DEBUG', false );\nNote: The true and false values in the example are not surrounded by apostrophes (‘) because they are boolean (true/false) values. If you set constants to 'false', they will be interpreted as true because the quotes make it a string rather than a boolean.\nIt is not recommended to use WP_DEBUG or the other debug tools on live sites; they are meant for local testing and staging installs.\nPHP Errors, Warnings, and Notices\nEnabling WP_DEBUG will cause all PHP errors, notices and warnings to be displayed. This is likely to modify the default behavior of PHP which only displays fatal errors and/or shows a white screen of death when errors are reached.\nShowing all PHP notices and warnings often results in error messages for things that don’t seem broken, but do not follow proper data validation conventions inside PHP. These warnings are easy to fix once the relevant code has been identified, and the resulting code is almost always more bug-resistant and easier to maintain.\nDeprecated Functions and Arguments\nEnabling WP_DEBUG will also cause notices about deprecated functions and arguments within WordPress that are being used on your site. These are functions or function arguments that have not been removed from the core code yet but are slated for deletion in the near future. Deprecation notices often indicate the new function that should be used instead.\nWP_DEBUG_LOG\nWP_DEBUG_LOG is a companion to WP_DEBUG that causes all errors to also be saved to a debug.log log file This is useful if you want to review all notices later or need to view notices generated off-screen (e.g. during an AJAX request or wp-cron run).\nNote that this allows you to write to log file using PHP’s built in error_log() function, which can be useful for instance when debugging Ajax events.\nWhen set to true, the log is saved to debug.log in the content directory (usually wp-content/debug.log) within your site’s filesystem. Alternatively, you can set it to a valid file path to have the file saved elsewhere.\ndefine( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );\n-or-\ndefine( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', '/tmp/wp-errors.log' );\nNote: for WP_DEBUG_LOG to do anything, WP_DEBUG must be enabled (true). Remember you can turn off WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY independently.\nWP_DEBUG_DISPLAY\nWP_DEBUG_DISPLAY is another companion to WP_DEBUG that controls whether debug messages are shown inside the HTML of pages or not. The default is ‘true’ which shows errors and warnings as they are generated. Setting this to false will hide all errors. This should be used in conjunction with WP_DEBUG_LOG so that errors can be reviewed later.\ndefine( 'WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );\nNote: for WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY to do anything, WP_DEBUG must be enabled (true). Remember you can control WP_DEBUG_LOG independently.\nSCRIPT_DEBUG\nSCRIPT_DEBUG is a related constant that will force WordPress to use the “dev” versions of core CSS and JavaScript files rather than the minified versions that are normally loaded. This is useful when you are testing modifications to any built-in .js or .css files. Default is false.\ndefine( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );\nSAVEQUERIES\nThe SAVEQUERIES definition saves the database queries to an array and that array can be displayed to help analyze those queries. The constant defined as true causes each query to be saved, how long that query took to execute, and what function called it.\ndefine( 'SAVEQUERIES', true );\nThe array is stored in the global $wpdb->queries.\nNOTE: This will have a performance impact on your site, so make sure to turn this off when you aren’t debugging.\nDebugging Plugins\nThere are many debugging plugins for WordPress that show more information about the internals, either for a specific component or in general. Here are some examples:\n\nQuery Monitor\nDebug Bar\nLog Deprecated Notices\n\nExternal Resources\n\nWordPress ‘wp-config.php’ file Generator\n‘No White Screen’ plugin: Display the error instead of a white screen\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/debugging-in-wordpress/", "title": "Debugging in WordPress – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Debugging PHP code is part of any project, but WordPress comes with specific debug systems designed to simplify the process as well as standardize code across the core, plugins and themes.

{"text": "\nWordPress uses a concept of Roles, designed to give the site owner the ability to control what users can and cannot do within the site. A site owner can manage the user access to such tasks as writing and editing posts, creating Pages, creating categories, moderating comments, managing plugins, managing themes, and managing other users, by assigning a specific role to each of the users.\nWordPress has six pre-defined roles: Super Admin, Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor and Subscriber. Each role is allowed to perform a set of tasks called Capabilities. There are many capabilities including “publish_posts“, “moderate_comments“, and “edit_users“. A default set of capabilities is pre-assigned to each role, but other capabilities can be assigned or removed using the add_cap() andremove_cap() functions. New roles can be introduced or removed using the add_role() and remove_role() functions.\nThe Super Admin role allows a user to perform all possible capabilities. Each of the other roles has a decreasing number of allowed capabilities. For instance, the Subscriber role has just the “read” capability. One particular role should not be considered to be senior to another role. Rather, consider that roles define the user’s responsibilities within the site.\nSummary of Roles\n\nSuper Admin – somebody with access to the site network administration features and all other features. See the Create a Network article.\nAdministrator (slug: ‘administrator’) – somebody who has access to all the administration features within a single site.\nEditor (slug: ‘editor’) – somebody who can publish and manage posts including the posts of other users.\nAuthor  (slug: ‘author’)  – somebody who can publish and manage their own posts.\nContributor (slug: ‘contributor’) – somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them.\nSubscriber (slug: ‘subscriber’) – somebody who can only manage their profile.\n\nUpon installing WordPress, an Administrator account is automatically created.\nThe default role for new users can be set in Administration Screens > Settings > General.\nRoles\nA Role defines a set of tasks a user assigned the role is allowed to perform. For instance, the Super Admin role encompasses every possible task that can be performed within a Network of virtual WordPress sites. The Administrator role limits the allowed tasks only to those which affect a single site. On the other hand, the Author role allows the execution of just a small subset of tasks.\nThe following sections list the default Roles and their capabilities:\nSuper Admin\nMultisite Super Admins have, by default, all capabilities. The following Multisite-only capabilities are therefore only available to Super Admins:       \n\ncreate_sites\ndelete_sites\nmanage_network\nmanage_sites\nmanage_network_users\nmanage_network_plugins\nmanage_network_themes\nmanage_network_options\nupgrade_network\nsetup_network\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of single site WordPress installation, Administrators are, in effect, Super Admins. As such, they are the only ones to have access to additional admin capabilities.\n\nAdministrator\n\nThe capabilities of Administrators differs between single site and Multisite WordPress installations. All administrators have the following capabilities:\n\n\n\n\nactivate_plugins\ndelete_others_pages\ndelete_others_posts\ndelete_pages\ndelete_posts\ndelete_private_pages\ndelete_private_posts\ndelete_published_pages\ndelete_published_posts\nedit_dashboard\nedit_others_pages\nedit_others_posts\nedit_pages\nedit_posts\nedit_private_pages\nedit_private_posts\nedit_published_pages\nedit_published_posts\nedit_theme_options\nexport\nimport\nlist_users\nmanage_categories\nmanage_links\nmanage_options\nmoderate_comments\npromote_users\npublish_pages\npublish_posts\nread_private_pages\nread_private_posts\nread\ncreate Reusable Blocks\nedit Reusable Blocks\nread Reusable Blocks\ndelete Reusable Blocks\nremove_users\nswitch_themes\nupload_files\ncustomize\ndelete_site\n\nAdditional Admin Capabilities\n\nOnly Administrators of single site installations have the following capabilities.

{"text": "\nThe Posts Screen provides the facility to manage all the Posts in a blog. Via this Screen, Posts can be edited, deleted, and viewed. Filtering, and searching, also makes it easy to quickly find Posts matching certain criteria.\nA powerful bulk edit feature allows Posts to be edited in bulk (en masse) allowing fields such as Author, Comments Allowed, Status, Pings Allowed, and Sticky to be changed for a whole batch of Posts. It is important to note that Categories and Tags can be ADDED in bulk to a set of Posts, but it is not possible to CHANGE, or DELETE, a Category, or Tag, for those Posts. In addition, a Quick Edit feature provides an easy method to change a mulititude of values, such as Title, Slug, Date, and Category, for a given Post.\nEdit Posts\nTable of Posts\nA table lists all of your Posts, by row. The Posts are listed with the newest Post first.\nAdministration post list screen\nThe table of Posts contains the following columns:\n[ ] – This checkbox, when clicked (checked), ‘selects’ that particular Post to be processed by a Bulk Action.Title – This is the Post’s Title displayed as a link. Click the Title link to allow this Post to be edited. Next to the Title, if a Post is of a Draft, Private, Pending, Sticky, or Password Protected nature, bold text will display showing that.“ID” – This is not a column in the Table, but by hovering the mouse over the Post Title, the Post ID is revealed as part of the URL displayed in the browser status bar (in Firefox the status bar is displayed at the bottom of the screen). A Post’s ID number is the unique number WordPress’ database uses to identify individual Posts.Author – Displayed in the form of a link, this is the author who wrote the Post. Clicking the author link causes all the Posts authored by that user to be displayed in the Table of Posts (thus allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all Posts for a given author).Categories – Displays all the Categories, in the form of links, to which this Post belongs. Each Category link, when clicked will cause the list of Posts assigned that Category to be displayed in the Table of Posts (note the Category Filter box at the top of the Table will depict the Category being displayed).Tags – Displays all the Tags, in the form of links, associated with a Post. Each Tag link, when clicked will cause the list of Posts assigned that Tag to be displayed in the Table of Posts.comment bubble – A comment bubble is the column heading, and each Post row has comment bubble with the number of comments for that Post. If a Posts has any comments, then the number comments is displayed in a blue bubble. Clicking on a blue comment bubble causes the Comments Screen to be displayed to allow moderation of those comments.Date – The Date column for each Post shows the Date ‘Published’ for Published Posts or the Date ‘Last Modified’ for other Posts. If the Post is a “future Post,” the scheduled date for publishing is displayed.\nSortable Columns\nSome column headings, such as the Title, Author, and Date, can be clicked to sort the Table of Posts in ascending or descending order. Hover over the column title, for example Title, to see the up-arrow or down-arrow. Click the heading to change the sort order.\nView\nJust to the right above the Table of Posts, two icons, List View, and Excerpt View, can be clicked to determine the amount of information listed with each Post. The default view is the List View and only the Post Title is listed for each Post. Click the Excerpt View to cause an excerpt for the Post to be displayed just below the Post Title.\nPage Navigation\nUnder the Screen Options, the number of Posts displayed per page is determined. If more then one page of Posts is available, two double-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided. Also two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or forward. Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to enter a page to directly display.\nScreen Options\nThe Screen Options allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column. Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options. In addition, the number of Posts per page can be set.\nSearch\nAbove the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the “Search Posts” button to search and display all the Posts meeting your search words.\nFiltering Options\nAt the top of this Screen are links such as All, Published, Schedules, Pending Review, Draft, Private, that when clicked, will cause just the Posts of that type to be displayed in the underlying Table.\nBelow that, and to the right of the Bulk Actions Apply button, are two other filter options:\nShow all dates\nThis dropdown allows you to select, by date, which Posts are displayed in the Table of Posts. By default, “Show all dates” is selected and all of your Posts are displayed.\nView all categories\nThis dropdown allows you to select, by Category, which Posts are displayed in the Table of Posts. By default, “Show all categories” is selected and all of your Posts are displayed.\nFilter\nClicking this button applies the settings you select in the dropdowns.\nUsing Selection, Actions, and Apply\nSelection\nThis Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more Posts selected in the Table. For Bulk Actions to be performed on multiple Posts at once, those Posts must be first selected via one of these methods:\nSelect one Post at a time – To select a Post, the checkbox to the left of the Post entry must be checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more Posts by checking their respective checkbox.\nActions\nActions describe the process to be performed on particular Posts. There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as Bulk Actions and Immediate Actions. The following describes these Actions:\nBulk Actions – These Actions can be performed on one, or more Posts, at one time, if those Posts have been previously selected. Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk Actions pulldown box, above the Table. The only Bulk Actions allowed are Edit and Delete.\nThe available Actions are described below:\nEdit – This Action can be either an “Immediate Action” or a “Bulk Action”. The Immediate Action, initiated by click on the Post Title or clicking on the Edit option just below the Post Title, causes the Edit Posts screen to display. Edit is also available as a Bulk Action for the selected Posts, so see the Bulk Edit section for details on the Bulk Editing process.\nBulk Edit\nThe Bulk Edit Posts ‘screen’ is displayed below the Table Of Posts header once, one, or more Posts, have been selected, and the Bulk Action of Edit is Applied. Bulk Edit allows the fields, Author, Comments Allowed, Status, Pings Allowed, and Sticky, to be changed for all the selected Posts. It is important to note, Categories and Tags can be ADDED in bulk to a set of Posts, but it is not possible to CHANGE, or DELETE, a Category, or Tag, for those Posts.\nCancel – Click Cancel to cancel and abort the Bulk Edit of these Posts.\nQuick Edit\nQuick Edit is an Immediate Action performed on one Post by clicking the Quick Edit link, under the Post Title in the Table of Posts. Quick Edit is just an in-line edit that allows you to change the following items–Title, Slug, Date, Author, Password or Private post box, Categories, Tags, Allow Comments, Allow Pings, Status, and Make this a post-sticky.\nCancel – Click Cancel to cancel and abort the Edit of this Post.\nEditing Individual Posts\nThis mode is essentially the same as the Posts Add New Screen so see the Posts_Add_New_Screen for the specific details of writing a Post. The only difference is that the button to save your work is called “Update” instead of “Publish“.\nApply\nAfter one or more Posts are selected, and after a Bulk Action is specified, the Apply button performs the given Action on the selected Posts.\nApply – Click the Apply button to execute the Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pulldown, on the selected Posts. Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more Posts must be selected, as described before.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/posts-screen/", "title": "Posts Screen – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "The Posts Screen provides the facility to manage all the Posts in a blog.

{"text": "\nWhat Are Smileys?\nSmileys, also known as “emoticons”, are glyphs used to convey emotions in your writing. They are a great way to brighten up posts. 🙂\nText smileys are created by typing two or more punctuation marks. Some examples are:\n;-) is equivalent to 😉\n:-) is equivalent to 🙂\n:-( is equivalent to 🙁\n:-? is equivalent to 😕\nTo learn more about emoticons and their history, see the Wikipedia entry on Emoticons.\nSmileys are not Emoji\nAlthough smileys and emoji can both display smiley faces and such, emoji are a newer development and have a much wider range of images that can be displayed. (They are also created differently.) For more information on emoji and how to use them, see the Emoji page.\nHow Does WordPress Handle Smileys?\nBy default, WordPress automatically converts text smileys to graphic images. When you type ;-) in your post you see 😉 when you preview or publish your post.\nTo Turn off Graphic Smileys\nAs of WordPress 4.3, the option to disable graphic smileys was removed from new installs. There is a plugin if you want to retain the option.\nWhat Text Do I Type to Make Smileys?\nSmiley images and the text used to produce them*:\nicontexttextfull texticonfull text🙂:):-):smile:😆:lol:😀:D:-D:grin:😳:oops:🙁:(:-(:sad:😥:cry:😮:o:-o:eek:👿:evil:😯8O8-O:shock:😈:twisted:😕:?:-?:???:🙄:roll:😎8)8-):cool:❗:!:😡:x:-x:mad:❓:?:😛:P:-P:razz:💡:idea:😐:|:-|:neutral:➡:arrow:😉;);-):wink::mrgreen:\n* In some instances, multiple text options are available to display the same smiley.\nCategory:Getting Started\nTroubleshooting Smileys\nWhy Doesn’t it Work?\nSmileys may have been disabled by your WordPress admin. Another possibility is the smiley image files have been deleted from /wp-includes/images/smilies.\nWhy Doesn’t it Work for Me?\nIf smileys work for others at your site but not for you:\nType a space before and after your smiley text. That prevents the smiley being accidentally included in the text around it. 😳\nMake sure not to use quotes or other punctuation marks before and after the smiley text. 🙄\nWhere Are My Smiley Images Kept?\nThe smiley or emoticon image graphics are found in the /wp-includes/images/smilies directory.\nNote that smileys is spelled ‘eys’ in this documentation and the directory name for the smiley images is ‘smilies, spelled ‘ies’. 😯\nHow Can I Have Different Smiley Images Appear?\nThe easiest way is to filter the smilies.\nUpload the images you want with the same name to your server (say in wp-content/images/smilies) and put this in your theme’s function.php:\n[code language=”php”]\nadd_filter( ‘smilies_src’, ‘my_custom_smilies_src’, 10, 3 );\nfunction my_custom_smilies_src( $img_src, $img, $siteurl )\n{\n        return $siteurl.’/wp-content/images/smilies/’.$img;\n}\n[/code]\nThat will replace http://example.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_question.gif with http://example.com/wp-content/images/smilies/icon_question.gif\nWhy are my Smiley Images Blank?\nIf you recently uploaded the images, it could be that the images have been uploaded in ASCII format by your FTP program. Re-upload the smileys ensuring that they are transferred in BINARY format.\nSome FTP programs have an auto-detect setting which will upload files in the correct format without user intervention. If you have such a setting, turn it on.\nSmiley CSS\nThe smiley images in WordPress are automatically given a CSS class of wp-smiley when they are displayed in a post. You can use this class to style your smileys differently from other post images.\nFor example, it’s not uncommon to set up images in a post to appear on the left-hand side of the content with text flowing around the image. The CSS for that might look like this:\n[code language=”php”]\n.post img {\n        float: left;\n}\n[/code]\nThis would typically affect all images in a post, including your smiley images. To override this so that smileys stay inline, you could add this to your CSS:\n[code language=”php”]\nimg.wp-smiley {\n        float: none;\n}\n[/code]\nFor more on CSS in WordPress, you might want to start here.\nMore Information on Smileys\nWikipedia – Emoticon\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/what-are-smilies/", "title": "What are smilies? – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "What Are Smileys?

{"text": "\nEach post in WordPress is filed under one or more Categories. This\naids in navigation and allows posts to be grouped with others of similar\n content.\n\nEach Category may be assigned to a Category Parent, allowing you\nto set up a hierarchy within the Category structure.  In creating\nCategories, recognize that each Category Name must be unique.  Thus,\neven if two Categories have two different Parents, they must still have\ndifferent names.\n\n\nLinks to your Categories are, by default, shown in two different places on your blog’s home page if you are using the WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme.   First, WordPress lists these Category as links in your sidebar.   Second, WordPress shows all the Categories to which a given post belongs  under that post.  When someone viewing your blog clicks on one of these  Category links, an archive page with all the posts belonging to that  Category will be displayed. \nThis Screen allows you to create new Categories, edit or delete existing ones, and organize your Categories hierarchically. \nCategories Screen\nThis Screen is divided into the Add New Category and Category Table sections.\n\nAdd New Category\nThis part of the Screen, which is conveniently linked to from the top of the Table of Categories,  allows you to create a new Category.  There are four pieces of  information associated with each new Category:  the name, slug, category  parent, and description. \nName:  To reiterate, the Category Name must be unique. \nSlug:  The Category slug must be unique. The Category Slug is used  in the URL. For example, setting a Category Name of “Recipes” and a  Category Slug of “food” would show all “Recipes” posts with a URL like example.com/blog/food/. \nParent:  Use this drop-down if you want to make this Category a  sub-Category; you will select the sub-Category’s Parent here.  For  example, you may have a Category called “Photos” but want to add further  clarification about the subject of a particular “Photos” post.  You  could add “Oregon Coast” and “Ice Storm” as sub-Categories to the  “Photos” Category; “Photos” would be the Parent of these two new  sub-Categories. \nSub-Categories show up on your blog’s page just like Categories,  except they will typically be nested under their Parent Categories.   When someone visits your site and clicks the “Photos” Category link, all  posts in “Photos” and all its sub-Categories will be displayed.  Clicking the “Oregon Coast” Category link only  displays those post in that sub-Category.  If you assign a post to a  sub-Category (e.g. “Oregon Coast”), you can choose to assign that post  to the sub-Category’s parent (“Photos”) or not.  Either way, all “Oregon  Coast” posts will show up in the “Photos” Category page.  The only  difference is that the list of Categories of which a particular post is  actually a member.  In the WordPress WordPress Twenty Seventeen theme, this list is shown below the text of each post.  Please note  that when creating templates, you cannot match a child category based on  the parent (ie: if category “bar” has parent “foo”, a template file  named “category-foo.php” will not match any “bar” category posts.) \nDescription:   Category Descriptions are optional.  Some themes take advantage of  Category Descriptions, others do not, so having Descriptions may or may  not modify the way Categories are displayed for your site.  Even if  they are not used by your site’s theme, you may still find them useful  from an administration point of view.\nAdd New Category: The most important part of the Add New Category box.  Once you’ve  entered in all the information about your new Category, use this button  to save it. \nTable of Categories\nThis table lists all of your categories by row.  Categories are\ndisplayed hierarchically and alphabetically;  subcategories are\ndisplayed beneath their parents and are prefaced by long dashes.  These\ndashed are not part of a Category’s name;  they are there only to show hierarchy.\n\nThe table of categories contains the following columns:\n\n[ ] – A checkbox that when clicked (checked), ‘selects’ that particular Category to be deleted when the Delete Action is Applied. Name – The name of the Category.  (Each name must be unique)Description – Categories may have an optional description.   By default, the description is shown to viewers when they hover over the  category’s link.Slug – The slug of a Category. (Usually in lower case letters)Posts – The number of posts which are members of the Category. Click on the number in the Posts column to be directed to the All Posts Screen to manage the Posts in that Category.\nScreen Options\nThe Screen Options  allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in  the underlying Table.  Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list  of the columns with a check-box next to each column.  Check the box for  each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not  display that column.  In addition, the number of Categories to display  in the Table of Categories can be set.  Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options. \nSearch\nAbove the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a\nword, or series of words, and click the “Search Categories” button to\nsearch and display all the Categories meeting your search words.\n\nUsing Selection, Actions, and Apply\nSelection\n\nThis section allows Actions to be performed on one or more\nCategories displayed in the Table.  For Actions to be performed on\nmultiple Categories at once, those Categories must be first selected via one of these methods:\n\nSelect one Category at a time – To select a Category, the\n checkbox to the left of the Category entry must be checked (clicked).\nIt is possible to keep selecting more Categories by checking their\nrespective checkbox.Select all Categories in given Table – All Categories in a\ngiven table can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table’s\ntitle, or footer bar.  Of course, unchecking the header or footer title\nbar checkbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT\nselected). Reverse Selection – A Reverse Selection means checked items\nbecome unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse\nSelection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and\nclicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.\nActions\n\nActions describe the process to be performed on particular\nCategories.  There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as\n Bulk Actions and Immediate Actions.  The follow describes these Actions:\n\nBulk Actions – These Actions can be performed on one, or more Categories, at one time, if those Categories have been previously selected.  Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Actions  pull-down box, above each Table.  The only Bulk Action allowed is  Delete.   Immediate Actions – Immediate Actions are performed  immediately, on an individual Category.  Hovering the mouse cursor over  the Category row reveals the Edit, Quick Edit, Delete and View options  under the Name column in that Category row.  Clicking on a Category Name  will also initiate the Edit Action.\n\nThe available Actions are described below:\n\nEdit – This Immediate Action displays the Edit Category  Screen to edit the Category fields.  This Action can be initiated by  click on the Category Name or clicking on the Edit option just below the  Category Name.  Quick Edit – This Immediate Action initiates the Quick Edit of that Category.  Delete – This Action deletes the Category.  Delete is  available as a Bulk Action and an Immediate Action. Note:  Deleting a  category does not delete the posts in that Category, but the posts that  were assigned to the deleted Category are assigned to the Default Category, as defined in the Settings Writing Screen.  Note that the Default Category cannot be deleted.View – This Action, if supported by the active theme’s template, will display the Posts belonging to the Category. View is available only as an Immediate Action.\nApply\n\nAfter one or more Categories are selected, and after a Bulk Action is specified, the Apply button performs the given Action on the selected Categories.\n\nApply – Click the Apply button to execute the  Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pull-down, on the selected  Categories.  Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more  Categories must be selected, as described before.\nQuick Edit\nThe following fields can be change via the Quick Edit Action:\nCategory name: To reiterate, the Category name must be unique. Category slug  Again, the Category slug must be unique.\nCancel: Click this button to cancel any changes and return to the Table of Categories\nUpdate Category: Once you’ve edited all the information about the Category, use this button to save the changes. \nEdit Category\nThis Screen is displayed by clicking on a Categories’ Name in the Table of Categories  or clicking on the Edit option just below the Category Name.  It is  possible to edit four pieces of information associated with each  Category:  the name, the slug, the parent, and the description.\nCategory name and Category Slug: Category name and Category Slug must be unique.  \nCategory Parent: Use this drop-down if you want to make this Category a  sub-Category; you will select the sub-Category’s Parent here.  For  example, you may have a Category called “Photos” but want to add further  clarification about the subject of a particular “Photos” post.  You  could add “Oregon Coast” and “Ice Storm” as sub-Categories to the  “Photos” Category; “Photos” would be the parent of these two new  sub-Categories.\nDescription: Category descriptions are optional.  Some themes take advantage of  Category descriptions, others do not, so having Descriptions may or may  not modify the way Categories are displayed for your site.  \nUpdate: Once you’ve changed the Category information, use this button to save the changes.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/posts-categories-screen/", "title": "Posts Categories Screen – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Each post in WordPress is filed under one or more Categories.

{"text": "\nUpdate Types\nAutomatic background updates were introduced in WordPress 3.7 in an effort to promote better security, and to streamline the update experience overall. By default, automatic updates of WordPress are enabled on most sites. In special cases, plugins and themes may be automatically updated as well. Translation files are auto-updated by default.\nIn WordPress, there are four types of automatic background updates:\nCore updatesPlugin updatesTheme updatesTranslation file updates\nCore Updates\nCore updates are subdivided into three types:\nCore development updates, known as the “bleeding edge”Minor core updates, such as maintenance and security releasesMajor core release updates\nBefore WordPress 5.6, by default, every site had automatic updates enabled for minor core releases and translation files only. Starting WordPress 5.6 and above, every new site has automatic enabled for both minor and major releases.\nSites already running a development version also have automatic updates to further development versions enabled by default.\nUpdate Configuration\nAutomatic updates can be configured using one of two methods: defining constants in wp-config.php, or adding filters using a Plugin.\nConfiguration via wp-config.php\nUsing wp-config.php, automatic updates can be disabled completely, and core updates can be disabled or configured based on update type.\nConstant to Disable All Updates\nThe core developers made a conscious decision to enable automatic updates for minor releases and translation files out of the box. Going forward, this will be one of the best ways to guarantee your site stays up to date and secure and, as such, disabling these updates is strongly discouraged.\nTo completely disable all types of automatic updates, core or otherwise, add the following to your wp-config.php file:\n[code language=”php”]define( ‘AUTOMATIC_UPDATER_DISABLED’, true );[/code]\nConstant to Configure Core Updates\nTo enable automatic updates for major releases or development purposes, the place to start is with the WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE constant. Defining this constant one of three ways allows you to blanket-enable, or blanket-disable several types of core updates at once.\n[code language=”php”]define( ‘WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE’, true );[/code]\nWP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE can be defined with one of three values, each producing a different behavior:\nValue of true – Development, minor, and major updates are all enabledValue of false – Development, minor, and major updates are all disabledValue of 'minor' – Minor updates are enabled, development, and major updates are disabled\nNote that only sites already running a development version will receive development updates.\nFor development sites, the default value of WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE is true. For other sites, the default value of WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE is minor.\nStarting WordPress 5.6, the default value of WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE for new WordPress installations is true. For new website, the default value of WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE is minor.\nConfiguration via Filters\nUsing filters allows for fine-tuned control of automatic updates.\nThe best place to put these filters is in a must-use plugin.\nDo not add add_filter() calls directly in wp-config.php. WordPress isn’t fully loaded and can cause conflicts with other applications such as WP-CLI.\nDisabling All Updates Via Filter\nYou can also disable all automatic updates using the following filter:\n[code language=”php”]add_filter( ‘automatic_updater_disabled’, ‘__return_true’ );[/code]\nCore Updates via Filter\nTo enable all core-type updates only, use the following filter:\n[code language=”php”]add_filter( ‘auto_update_core’, ‘__return_true’ );[/code]\nBut let’s say rather than enabling or disabling all three types of core updates, you want to selectively enable or disable them. That’s where the allow_dev_auto_core_updates, allow_minor_auto_core_updates, and allow_major_auto_core_updates filters come in.\nThere are two shorthand functions built into WordPress that will allow you to enable or disable specific types of core updates with single lines of code. They are __return_true and __return_false. Here are some example filters:\nTo specifically enable them individually (for disabling, use false instead of true):\n[code language=”php”]add_filter( ‘allow_dev_auto_core_updates’, ‘__return_true’ );           // Enable development updates\nadd_filter( ‘allow_minor_auto_core_updates’, ‘__return_true’ );         // Enable minor updates\nadd_filter( ‘allow_major_auto_core_updates’, ‘__return_true’ );         // Enable major updates[/code]\nFor Developers: To enable automatic updates even if a VCS folder (.git, .hg, .svn etc) was found in the WordPress directory or any of its parent directories:\n[code language=”php”]add_filter( ‘automatic_updates_is_vcs_checkout’, ‘__return_false’, 1 );[/code]\nPlugin & Theme Updates via Filter\nBy default, automatic background updates only happen for plugins and themes in special cases, as determined by the WordPress.org API response, which is controlled by the WordPress security team for patching critical vulnerabilities. To enable or disable updates in all cases, you can leverage the auto_update_$type filter, where $type would be replaced with “plugin” or “theme”.\nAutomatic updates for All plugins\n[code language=”php”]add_filter( ‘auto_update_plugin’, ‘__return_true’ );[/code]\nAutomatic updates for All themes:\n[code language=”php”]add_filter( ‘auto_update_theme’, ‘__return_true’ );[/code]\nYou can use __return_false instead of __return_true to specifically disable all plugin & theme updates, even forced security pushes from the WordPress security team.\nThe auto_update_$type filters also allow for more fine-grained control, as the specific item to updated is also passed into the filter. If you wanted to enable auto-updates for specific plugins only, then you could use code like this:\n[code language=”php”]function auto_update_specific_plugins ( $update, $item ) {\n\t// Array of plugin slugs to always auto-update\n\t$plugins = array (\n\t\t‘akismet’,\n\t\t‘buddypress’,\n\t);\n\tif ( in_array( $item->slug, $plugins ) ) {\n\t\t // Always update plugins in this array\n\t\treturn true;\n\t} else {\n\t \t// Else, use the normal API response to decide whether to update or not\n\t\treturn $update;\n\t}\n}\nadd_filter( ‘auto_update_plugin’, ‘auto_update_specific_plugins’, 10, 2 );[/code]\nTranslation Updates via Filter\nAutomatic translation file updates are already enabled by default, the same as minor core updates.\nTo disable translation file updates, use the following:\n[code language=”php”]add_filter( ‘auto_update_translation’, ‘__return_false’ );[/code]\nDisable Emails via Filter\n[code language=”php”]// Disable update emails\nadd_filter( ‘auto_core_update_send_email’, ‘__return_false’ );[/code]\nThis filter can also be used to manipulate update emails according to email $type (success, fail, critical), update type object $core_update, or $result:\n[code language=”php”]/* @param bool   $send        Whether to send the email. Default true.\n@param string $type        The type of email to send. Can be one of ‘success’, ‘fail’, ‘critical’.\n@param object $core_update The update offer that was attempted.\n@param mixed  $result      The result for the core update. Can be WP_Error.\n*/\napply_filters( ‘auto_core_update_send_email’, true, $type, $core_update, $result );[/code]\nResources\nMore examples at https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/25/the-definitive-guide-to-disabling-auto-updates-in-wordpress-3-7/More information here: http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/120081/how-do-i-configure-automatic-updates-in-wordpress-3-7Info about wp-cli conflict: https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/issues/1310\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/configuring-automatic-background-updates/", "title": "Configuring Automatic Background Updates – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Update Types Automatic background updates were introduced in WordPress 3.7 in an effort to promote better security, and to streamline the update experience overall.

Filtering, and searching, also makes it easy to quickly find Pages matching certain criteria.\nSeveral powerful features allow Pages to be edited in bulk (en masse) allowing fields such as Author, Parent, Template, Comments Allowed, Status, and Pings Allowed, to be changed for a whole batch of Pages. In addition, a Quick Edit feature provides an easy method to change a multitude of values, such as Title, Slug, Date, and Author, for a given Page.\n\nPages Screen\nTable of Pages\nA table lists all of your Pages, by row.

A Page’s ID number is the unique number WordPress’ database uses to identify individual Pages.Author – Displayed in the form of a link, this is the author who wrote the Page. Clicking the author link causes all the Pages authored by that user to be displayed in the Table of Pages (thus allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all Pages for a given author).comment bubble – A comment bubble is the column heading, and each Page row has comment bubble with the number of comments for that Page. If a Pages has any comments, then the number comments is displayed in a blue bubble. Clicking on a blue comment bubble causes the Comments Screen to be displayed to allow moderation of those comments.Date – The Date column for each Page shows the Date ‘Published’ for Published Pages and the Date ‘Last Modified’ for other Pages.\nSortable Columns\nSome column headings, such as the Title, Author, and Date, can be clicked to sort the Table of Pages in ascending or descending order. Hover over the column title, for example Title, to see the up-arrow or down-arrow. Click the heading to change the sort order.\nPage Navigation\nUnder the Screen Options, the number of Pages displayed per page is determined. If more then one page of Pages is available, two double-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided. Also two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or forward. Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to enter a page to directly display.\nScreen Options\nThe Screen Options allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Table. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the columns with a check-box next to each column. Check the box for each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not display that column. In addition, the number of Pages per page can be set. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.\nSearch\nAbove the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a word, or series of words, and click the “Search Pages” button to search and display all the Pages meeting your search words.\nFiltering Options\nAt the top of this Screen are links such as All, Published, Pending Review, Draft, Private, that when clicked, will cause just the Pages of that type to be displayed in the underlying Table.\nBelow that, and to the right of the Bulk Actions Apply button, are one other filter option:\nShow all dates\nThis dropdown allows you to select, by date, which Pages are displayed in the Table of Pages. By default, “Show all dates” is selected and all of your Posts are displayed.\nFilter\nClicking this button applies the settings you select in the dropdowns.\nUsing Selection, Actions, and Apply\nSelection\nThis Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more Pages selected in the Table. For Bulk Actions to be performed on multiple Pages at once, those Pages must be first selected via one of these methods:\nSelect one Page at a time – To select a Page, the checkbox to the left of the Page entry must be checked (clicked). It is possible to keep selecting more Pages by checking their respective checkbox.\nActions\nActions describe the process to be performed on particular Pages. There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as Bulk Actions and Immediate Actions. The following describes these Actions:\nBulk Actions – These Actions can be performed on one, or more Pages, at one time, if those Pages have been previously selected. Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk Actions pulldown box, above the Table. The only Bulk Actions allowed are Edit and Delete.\nThe available Actions are described below:\nEdit – This Action can be either an “Immediate Action” or a “Bulk Action”. The Immediate Action, initiated by click on the Title or clicking on the Edit option just below the Title, causes the Edit Pages screen to display. Edit is also available as a Bulk Action for the selected Pages, so see the Bulk Edit section for details on the Bulk Editing process.\nBulk Edit\nThe Bulk Edit Pages ‘screen’ is displayed below the Table Of Pages header once, one, or more, Pages have been selected, and the Bulk Action of Edit is Applied. Bulk Edit allows the fields Author, Parent, Template, Comments Allowed, Status, and Pings Allowed, to be changed for all the selected Pages.\nCancel – Click Cancel to cancel and abort the Bulk Edit of these Pages.\nQuick Edit\nQuick Edit is an Immediate Action performed on one Page by clicking the Quick Edit link under the Page Title in the Table of Pages.

{"text": "\nIf you’ve been on the internet for any amount of time you’re probably familiar with “spam” in your email inbox. For the uninitiated, spam is an unsolicited commercial message, or something you didn’t ask for trying to sell you something.\nSo what does this have to do with blogs? Well just like you can get spam messages in your inbox, people will leave spam comments on your blog. However unlike email spam where the target is you, comment spam generally targets search engines.\nComment Spam and Search Engines\nWhy on earth would a spammer use your blog to target a search engine? Let’s start from the beginning. Several years ago, Google pioneered a search technique called PageRank. Basically, in addition to looking at the content of the page being indexed, Google also takes into account who links to the page and what those links say. This technology meant Google was very good at returning relevant results, making it the most popular search engine today. Because their ranking system relies so heavily on PageRank, people sometimes game the system using a technique called “Google Bombing.”\nA google bomb is when a large number of different websites link to a page with the same link text to influence the ranking of that page for a search term.\nThis brings us back to the spammers. A spammer might have a site that sells “mydrug” and wants to be at the top of search results for “mydrug” on Google. They leave comments on hundreds or thousands of weblogs linking to their site with the link text “mydrug.” They don’t really care if you see their google bomb text—in fact they’d rather you didn’t in case you decide to delete it! They just want the search engine to see it when they index your page.\nFighting Comment Spam\nComment Moderation is very effective in addressing unwanted comments. The best defense against comment spam is just watching your comments. Under Manage →︎ Comments it shows a listing of the latest comments on any post and you can quickly scan the comment activity on your site. The faster you respond to comment spam on your site, the less likely the spammers will return.\nOn the Combating Comment Spam page you will find a list of more proactive measures against comment spam, including links to helpful plugins.\nStealth Spam\nSpammers find new and creative ways to be sneaky all the time. You may notice that posters leave comments on your site which look perfectly normal except for the commenter’s name or URL, which likely references a product or a site selling something.\nIt’s good practice to visit the URLs of people who leave comments on your blog to determine whether the poster is sincere or spammy. If you see one that looks suspicious, you can choose to delete the comment entirely or leave the comment and just delete the URL.\nAnother way of stealth is to use a div-tag around a bundle of hundreds of links. This becomes more and more common because many software displays directly the given HTML tags and not the HTML code. To avoid this the software must “strip-out”, other word: filter the HTML tags while inserting the comment into the database.\nThe Good News\nThe good news is that WordPress’ built-in tools and history of combating comment spam mean that most WordPress blogs get very little spam, and when they do it’s easy to address. Here’s a quote from noted web author Molly E. Holzschlag about comment spam and her switch to WordPress:\nMy ISP refused to continue dealing with me because the server molly.com resided on was brought to its knees twice due to spam floods. I was spending up to two hours PER DAY to undo the spam much less post. Since switching to WP, I’ve had exactly five emails sent to me automagically for moderation. 3 of them were spam, 2 were just enthusiastic posts with multiple links from a reader.\nSee also : Troubleshooting comment spam\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/understand-comment-spam/", "title": "Understand comment spam – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "If you've been on the internet for any amount of time you're probably familiar with \"spam\" in your email inbox.

The difference between them is:\nTrackbacks – must be created manually, and send an excerpt of the content.Pingbacks – are automated and don’t send any content.\nCheck out the article on the WordPress user document for a more detailed explanation.\nPingbacks\nA pingback is a type of comment that’s created when you link to another blog post where pingbacks are enabled. The best way to think about pingbacks is as remote comments:\nPerson A posts something on his blog.Person B posts on her own blog, linking to Person A’s post. This automatically sends a pingback to Person A when both have pingback enabled blogs.Person A’s blog receives the pingback, then automatically goes to Person B’s post to confirm that the pingback did, in fact, originate there.\nTo create a pingback, just link to another blog post. If that post has pingbacks enabled, the blog owner will see a pingback appear in their comments section that they can approve. Comments are styled differently for each theme. Here is an example of how a pingback appears: \n\nCan I stop self-pings?\nYes. Self-pings (pings within your own blog) are found useful by some, annoying by others. Those who find them useful feel that if someone finds the old post that they will see the link to the new post. But some still disagree. Normally when you create a link, the entire URL including http:// is used. That will cause a self-ping. To prevent self-pings, shorten the URL from\nhttp://example.com/2021/06/16/twitter-widget\nto\n/2021/06/16/twitter-widget\nNote: Editor’s visual mode may add the domain information back into the link. To check that, you must switch to the HTML mode and make sure the link is displayed correctly in the href attribute for the link before publishing.\nDisabling Pingbacks\nYou can easily disable pingbacks on individual posts via the Discussion metabox on your Add New or Edit Post page:\n\nTrackbacks\nTrackbacks are a way to notify legacy blog systems that you’ve linked to them. If you link to a WordPress blog they’ll be notified automatically using pingbacks, no other action necessary. Think of trackbacks as the equivalent of acknowledgements and references at the end of an academic paper or chapter in a text book. To send a trackback, add the trackback URI from the other blog post to the Send Trackbacks module in your blog post before you publish it. A trackback URI from a WordPress blog will end with /trackback/.\nHow do I send a Trackback (Classic Editor Only)\nGo to the post on the other person’s blog and look for the ‘Trackback URI’ or similar. \n\n Once you have that link you need to copy the URL of the link. In Chrome, Right-click on the link and Copy Link Address.\nBack on your blog, scroll down from the editor to the Trackbacks module and paste the URL into that box. If the blog where it was copied from is a WordPress blog, the URL will end with /trackback/. \n\n Publish your post and the trackback will be sent.

By default, a standard post will have two taxonomy types called Categories and Tags which are a handy way of ensuring related content on your website is easy for visitors to find. These two types of taxonomies are included in WordPress by default, but just like any other taxonomy, can be removed or changed and you can even add more if you like.\nTaxonomies & Terms\nThe relationship between taxonomies and terms is rather simple; think of taxonomies as the ‘parent’ and terms as the ‘children’. For example, a taxonomy called ‘Recipes’ for the ‘Food’ post type could have multiple terms such as ‘Vegetarian’ or ‘Fresh’, ‘Easy Cooking’.\nAnother example is where you might have a post type called Reviews and a new post called ‘Best Films of The Year’. You can help define this content by having a taxonomy called ‘Films’ and create new terms such ‘Top Picks’ or ‘Film Reviews’. All this does is help define your content into smaller chunks making it much easier to find and focus on.\nNew Taxonomies & Terms\nAs of WordPress version 2.3 you can create your own taxonomies for use on your website or blog with a small amount of code.

{"text": "\nWordPress Widgets add content and features to your Sidebars. Examples are the default widgets that come with WordPress; for Categories, Tag cloud, Search, etc. Plugins will often add their own widgets.\nWidgets were originally designed to provide a simple and easy-to-use way of giving design and structure control of the WordPress Theme to the user, which is now available on properly “widgetized” WordPress Themes to include the header, footer, and elsewhere in the WordPress design and structure.\nWidgets require no code experience or expertise. They can be added, removed, and rearranged on the Theme Customizer or Appearance > Widgets in the WordPress Administration Screens.\nSome WordPress Widgets offer customization and options such as forms to fill out, includes or excludes of data and information, optional images, and other customization features.\nThe Block-based Widgets Editor explains how to use the updated Widgets experience with blocks. \nThe Appearance Widgets Screen explains how to use the various Widgets that come with WordPress in the Classic experience.\nPlugins that come bundled with widgets can be found in the WordPress Plugin Directory.\nInstalling Widgets\nWordPress comes pre-packaged with a variety of Widgets. If those are insufficient for your needs you can install new ones by searching the WordPress Plugin Directory which is accessible from the WordPress Administration Plugins > Add New Screen.\nDisplaying Widgets\nExisting Widgets in Existing Widget Areas\nBefore you can add a Widget you must verify that the Theme you’re using supports Widgets (more specifically: Widget Area). You can do so by simply navigating to the Appearance menu and looking for a sub menu titled “Widgets”.\nIf your Theme supports Theme Customizer then you can use the following Steps. In Theme Customizer, the live preview of changes is available.\n\n\nGo to Appearance > Customize in the WordPress Administration Screens.\nClick the Widget menu in the Theme Customizer to access to the Widget Customize Screen.\nClick the down arrow of Widget Area to list the already registered Widgets.\nClick Add a Widget button at the bottom of sidebar. It shows the list of available widgets.\nClick a widget you want to add. The widgets should be added in the sidebar.\nPreview your site and you should see the content from your new Widget.\nTo arrange the Widgets within the Sidebar, drag and drop the widgets in the order you want or click Reorder link and click up arrow and down allow of each widget and click Done after the arrange operation.\nTo customize the Widget features, click the down arrow in the right to expand the Widget’s interface.\nTo remove the widget, click Remove from Widget’s interface in above step.\n\nIf your Theme does not support Theme Customizer then you can use the following conventional steps:\n\n\nGo to Appearance > Widgets in the WordPress Administration Screens.\nChoose a Widget and either drag it to the sidebar where you wish it to appear, or click the widget, (select a destination sidebar if your theme has more than one) and click the Add Widget button. There might be more than one sidebar option, so begin with the first one. Once in place, WordPress automatically updates the Theme.\nPreview the site. You should find that the “default” sidebar elements are now gone and only the new addition is visible.\nReturn to the Widgets Screen to continue adding Widgets.\nTo arrange the Widgets within the sidebar or Widget area, click and drag it into place.\nTo customize the Widget features, click the down arrow in the upper right corner to expand the Widget’s interface.\nTo save the Widget’s customization, click Save.\nTo remove the Widget, click Delete.\n\nIf you want to remove the widget but save its setting for possible future use, just drag it into the Inactive Widgets area. You can add them back anytime from there. This is especially helpful when you switch to a theme with fewer or different widget areas.\nWhen changing themes, there is often some variation in the number and setup of widget areas/sidebars and sometimes these conflicts make the transition a bit less smooth. If you changed themes and seem to be missing widgets, scroll down on the screen to the Inactive Widgets area, where all of your widgets and their settings will have been saved.\nEnabling Accessibility Mode, via Screen Options, allows you to use Add and Edit buttons instead of using drag and drop.\nWidget Areas\nWhile widget areas typically occur in webpage sidebars, a theme can place widget areas anywhere on a page. For example, besides the usual sidebar locations, the Twenty Seventeen theme has a widget area in the footer of every page.\nUsing Text Widgets\nThe Text Widget is one of the most commonly used WordPress Widgets that comes with every WordPress installation. It allows users to add text, video, images, custom lists, and more to their WordPress sites.\nTo use the WordPress Text Widget:\n\nGo to Appearance > Customize in the WordPress Administration Screens and click the Widget menu in the Theme Customizer. Or Go to Appearance > Widgets in the WordPress Administration Screens.\nOpen the sidebar to which you wish to add the Text Widget.\nFind the Text Widget in the list of Widgets.\nClick and drag the Widget to the spot you wish it to appear.\n\nTo open and edit the Text Widget:\n\nClick the down arrow to the right of the Text Widget title.\nSet the Text Widget Title (optional).\nAdd the text or HTML code to the box or edit what is currently there.\nChoose the option to Automatically add paragraphs to wrap each block of text in an HTML paragraph tag (recommended for text).\nClick Save to save the Text Widget.\nClick Close to close the Text Widget.\nSwitch tabs in your browser and preview the results and make changes if necessary.\n\nThe Text Widget can hold a variety of HTML, XHTML, and multimedia links and players such as video and object embeds.\nAdding Code to the Text Widget\nBasic HTML, embeds, and JavaScript are added easily to the WordPress Text Widget. Most embed codes from social sharing sites for multimedia will work in a WordPress Text Widget. However, active code and programming languages such as PHP will not work as the Widget will strip out code it cannot display.\nTo add active code to the Text Widget, use one of the many WordPress Plugins from the WordPress Plugin Directory that override WordPress restrictions on using PHP in posts. Check that they will work on Widgets as some will not.\nUsing RSS Widgets\nThe RSS Widget allows you to integrate an external feed source for content into a Widget area of your site, such as your Twitter account, Facebook posts, Google+ posts, or other blogs.\nThe RSS Widget displays the most recently published content from any source with an active feed. This is an ideal way of integrating outside content into your site.\nBy default, WordPress RSS Widget displays the post title or the first 100 or so characters of a Tweet or long untitled post. These are either in the form of a link or features a link to the original source depending upon the feed’s design and structure.\n\nEnter the RSS feed URL in the first box, copied from the source page for the content you wish to include in your sidebar or other widgetized space.\nGive the feed a title: This is optional and gives you the chance to showcase the source of the content.\nHow many items would you like to display?: By default, 10 are show, but you can choose from 1-20 posts.\nDisplay item content?: This allows you to show an excerpt of the content not just the title.\nDisplay item author if available?: If you wish to give credit to the original author of the content, check this to display the author.\nDisplay item date?: If available, the date of the original content will be shown.\n\nYou may add multiple RSS Widgets for incoming feeds to your WordPress sidebar and other widgetized areas of your site.\nResources\n\nWordPress Widgets Announcement (historical reference)\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/manage-wordpress-widgets/", "title": "Manage WordPress widgets – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "WordPress Widgets add content and features to your Sidebars.

{"text": "\nIn the Comments Screen you can edit or delete content found in comments to your posts, and you can mark comments as spam, send comments to the trash,  and reply to comments.  A number of rules can be defined about who can  write comments, and how comments are moderated.  These rules are managed  via Administration > Settings > Discussion. \nComments Screen\nComments\nTable of Comments\nThe Table of Comments displays all the comments, with the most recent  comment displayed first.  \n[ ] – This checkbox, when clicked (checked), ‘selects’ that particular comment to be processed by a Bulk Action.Gravatar – This is a picture or gravatar of the comment author.  Author – This is the name of the comment author.  Below the  comment author name is the comment author’s email address that can be  clicked to begin an email to that address.  Below the email address is  the commenter’s web-site in the form of a URL that can be click to visit  that commenter’s web-site.  Below the email address is commenter’s IP  address in the form of a link.  Clicking that IP address link causes all  the comments originated by that IP address to be displayed thus  allowing a Bulk Action to be applied to all comments from that address.Comment – The first item in this column is the comment date  and time presented as a link.  Click the date and time will take you to  that comment on your live site. Below the date and time is the actual  comment that was submitted. Hovering over any comment gives you  Immediate Actions that can be performed on that comment.In Response To – There are three elements. The text is the  name of the post that inspired the comment, and links to the post editor  for that entry. The View Post link leads to that post on your live  site. The small bubble with the number in it shows the number of  approved comments that post has received. If the bubble is gray, you  have moderated all comments for that post. If it is blue, there are  pending comments. Clicking the bubble will filter the comments screen to  show only comments on that post.\nSortable Columns\nSome column headings, such as the Author, and In Response To, can be\nclicked to sort the Table of Comments in ascending or descending order.\n Hover over the column title, for example Author, to see the up-arrow or\n down-arrow.  Click the heading to change the sort order.\n\nPage Navigation\nUnder the Screen Options, the number of Comments displayed per page\nis determined.  If more then one page of Comments is available, two\ndouble-arrow boxes to move to the first and last page are provided.\nAlso two single-arrow boxes are displayed to move one page backward or\nforward.  Finally, a box showing the current page number can be used to\nenter a page to directly display.\n\nScreen Options\nThe Screen Options  allow you to choose which columns are displayed, or not displayed, in  the underlying Table.  Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list  of the columns with a check-box next to each column.  Check the box for  each column you want displayed in the Table, or uncheck the box to not  display that column.  In addition, the number of items you want  displayed in the table can be set.  Choose 1 to 999.  Click the Screen  Options tab again to close the Screen Options. \nSearch\nAbove the Table, to the right, is a search box where you can enter a\nword, or series of words, and click the “Search Comments” button to\nsearch and display all the comments meeting your search words.\n\nFiltering Options\nAt the top of this Screen are links such as All, Pending, Approved,\nSpam, and Trash, that when clicked, will cause just the comments of that\n type to be displayed in the underlying Table.\n\nBelow that and to the right of the Bulk Actions Apply button, is another filter option:\nShow all comment types\nThis drop-down allows you to select, by type, which Posts are displayed in the Table of Comments.   By default, “Show all comment types” is selected and all of the  comments are displayed.  Besides all comment types, this pull-down offers  the ability to filter just comments or just pings. \nUsing Selection, Actions, and Apply\nSelection\n\nThis Screen allows Bulk Actions to be performed on one or more\ncomments selected in the Table.  For Bulk Actions to be performed on\nmultiple comments at once, those comments must be first selected via one of these methods:\n\nSelect one comment at a time – To select a comment, the\ncheckbox to the left of the comment entry must be checked (clicked).  It\n is possible to keep selecting more comments by checking their\nrespective checkbox.Select all comments in given Table – All comments in a given\ntable can be selected by checking the checkbox in the Table’s title, or\nfooter bar.  Of course, unchecking the header or footer title bar\ncheckbox will cause all entries in that Table to be unchecked (NOT\nselected). Reverse Selection – A Reverse Selection means checked items\nbecome unchecked, and unchecked items become checked. A Reverse\nSelection is accomplished by holding the Shift key on the keyboard and\nclicking the header or footer title bar checkbox.\nActions\n\nActions describe the process to be performed on particular\ncomments.  There are two styles of Actions that will be referred to as Bulk Actions and Immediate Actions.  The following describes these Actions:\n\nBulk Actions – These Actions can be performed on one, or more comments, at one time, if those comments have been previously selected.  Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Bulk  Actions pull-down box, above the Table.  The Bulk Actions allowed are  Unapprove, Approve, Mark as Spam, and Move to Trash.   Immediate Actions – Immediate Actions are performed  immediately, on an individual comment.  When the mouse cursor is moved  over (hover) a comment, in the Comment column, under the comment itself  the Immediate Actions of Unapprove, Reply, Quick Edit, Edit, Spam, and  Trash appear as links.  Click one of those links to initiate the  corresponding Immediate Action.\n\nThe available Actions are described below:\n\nApprove/Unapprove – This Action is shared by one link.   If a comment is currently in an approved state then this link shows as  Unapprove (in orange), but if the comment is Unapproved this link shows  as Approve (in green).  Clicking the Approve or Unapprove link changes  the comment to the opposite status.  Both Approve and Unapprove are  available as Bulk Actions.Reply – Available only as an Immediate Action.  Clicking  action cause the Reply to Comment edit window to display below the  current comment and a reply to that comment can be made and sent when  the Reply button is clicked. Quick Edit – Quick Edit is an “Immediate Action” that allows a quick in-line edit of the comment.  See the Quick Edit section for details on this Action.Edit – This Action, an Immediate Action, initiated by click on the Edit option just below the comment, causes the Comments Edit Screen to display. Spam – This Action, shown in red, marks the comment as spam.   Spam is available both as a Bulk Action, and an Immediate Action.  See  the Spam section for details on this Action.Trash – This Action, shown in red, sends the comment to the  trash bin.  Comments sent to the Trash later be restored or deleted  permanently.  Trash is available both as a Bulk Action, and an Immediate  Action.  See the Trash section for details on this Action.\nQuick Edit\n\nQuick Edit is an Immediate Action performed on one comment by\nclicking the Quick Edit link, under the comment in the Table of\nComments.  Quick Edit is just an in-line edit that allows you to change\nthe following items–Name of commenter, Email of commenter, URL of\ncommenter, and the comment.\n\nCancel – Click Cancel to cancel and abort the Edit of this comment.Update Comment – Click Update Comment to save the Edits made to this comment.\nSpam\n Once a comment has been marked as Spam,  that comment and other Spam comments can be accessed via the Spam  Filtering link above the Table of Comments.  Once those Spam comments  are accessed via that Filter link, then each Spam comment can be  Unspammed or can be Deleted Permanently.  In addition an Empty Spam  button can be clicked and all comments that are marked as Spam are  deleted permanently.  The Empty Spam button deletes all Spam comments  even if the comments are not selected. \nTrash\n Once a comment as be sent to the Trash,  that and other Trashed comments can be accessed via the Trash Filtering  link above the Table of Comments.  Each of the Trashed comments can be  Restored to the previous state before that comment was sent to the  Trash.  In addition, an Empty Trash button can be clicked and all  comments in the Trash are deleted permanently.  The Empty Trash button  deletes all Trash comments even if the comments are not selected. \nApply\n\nAfter one or more comments are selected, and after a Bulk Action is specified, the Apply button performs the given Action on the selected comments.\n\nApply – Click the Apply button to execute the  Bulk Action, specified in the Actions pull-down, on the selected  comments.  Remember, prior to executing Actions, one or more comments  must be selected, as described before.\nEdit Comment\nOnce a comment is edited this Screen display and allows the user to change the comment and the status of the comment. \nEdit Comment Screen\nAuthor\nName – The name given by the author of the comment.E-mail – The e-mail address given by the author of the comment.URL – The web-site URL given by the author of the comment.Comment\nEdit Comment box – The edit box containing the content where changes can be made to said text.Status\nApproved – Radio button to mark this comment as approved.Pending – Radio button to mark this comment as pending (unapproved).Spam – Radio button to mark this comment as spam.Submitted on – Click the Edit button to edit the date and time this comment was submitted.Actions\nView Comment – Views the entire comment and post as displayed on the blog.

{"text": "\nPost Visibility Settings\nOnce you publish a WordPress post (or Page), it is visible to the public (by default). In WordPress terms, this means a post with a Published status has a default visibility of Public, based on the settings in the Publish box of a Edit Post Screen.\nWordPress also offers two less public options for your post’s Content Visibility. Clicking the “Edit” link next to Visibility: Public reveals three radio buttons:\nPublic is selected by default.Checking Password protected reveals a text field for entering a password, that will be required to view that post. The password is limited to 20 characters.Checking Private makes your post visible only to your site’s Users with the role of Administrator or Editor.Visibility Settings\n\nWhen you’re done editing the post’s visibility, click the “OK” button. You should now see your post’s new setting, e.g., Visibility: Password Protected.Remember: a setting change does not take effect until you click the “Publish” button (or “Update” if the post is already published.)\nFinding or Changing a Password\nOnly an Administrator, Editor, or the post’s Author can change a post’s password or visibility setting. To do so, use the “Visibility: Edit” link again. These settings are also available using the post’s Quick Edit link in the All Posts Screen.\nThe Visibility “Edit” link (or “Quick Edit”) is also a good way to reveal a forgotten post password.\nPassword Protected Posts\n\nWordPress displays a password-protected post differently. It makes these changes to the post’s:\nTitle– Adds the text “Protected: ” before the post Title.Excerpt– Instead of the post Excerpt, prints this text: “There is no excerpt because this is a protected post.”Content– Instead of the post Content, prints a password form with this text: “This post is password protected. To view it please enter your password below:”\n\nSo, a password-protected post with a title of “My Post” would display like this: \nPassword Protecting Many Posts and Pages\nWordPress stores this password in a browser cookie so readers don’t have to re-enter passwords if they visit the same page multiple times. Furthermore, if multiple posts use the same password, the reader will only have to enter the password once to access every post (see caveat below).\nWordPress will only track one password at a time. Therefore, if two posts use two different passwords, entering the password for post A, then entering the password for post B means that revisiting post A (or any post which shares its password) will require the user to re-enter the password for post A.\nProtect Custom Fields\nWordPress does not print a password-protected post’s Content or Excerpt until the correct password is entered. But a post’s Custom Field(s) data is not protected, and can still show. To stop CFs from printing, wrap your get_post_meta calls (e.g., in single.php or page.php) with a conditional statement using: post_password_required. This one WordPress function checks both whether your post requires a password and whether the correct password has been provided:\n<?php\nif ( ! post_password_required() ) {\n    // Code to fetch and print CFs, such as:\n    $key_1_value_1 = get_post_meta( $post->ID, 'key_1', true );\n        echo $key_1_value_1;\n}\n?>\n\nThe post_password_required function within in an if statement is also handy for other customizations, such as preventing password-protected posts from displaying in a list.\nCustomize the Protected Text\nWith WordPress Filters you can: change the default text in the password form, change the default text for the password-protected post Excerpt, and insert the password form into the post Excerpt. To do so, add the following code to your custom plugin file.\nPassword Form Text\nThe password form displays this default message: “This post is password protected. To view it please enter your password below:” The following code will return the form with different text and different html structure — in this example the custom message is: “To view this protected post, enter the password below:”\n<?php\nfunction my_password_form() {\n    global $post;\n    $label = 'pwbox-'.( empty( $post->ID ) ? rand() : $post->ID );\n    $o = '<form action=\"' . esc_url( site_url( 'wp-login.php?action=postpass', 'login_post' ) ) . '\" method=\"post\">\n    ' . __( \"To view this protected post, enter the password below:\" ) . '\n    <label for=\"' . $label . '\">' . __( \"Password:\" ) . ' </label><input name=\"post_password\" id=\"' . $label . '\" type=\"password\" size=\"20\" maxlength=\"20\" /><input type=\"submit\" name=\"Submit\" value=\"' . esc_attr__( \"Submit\" ) . '\" />\n    </form>\n    ';\n    return $o;\n}\nadd_filter( 'the_password_form', 'my_password_form' );\n?>\n\nPlease note: the my_password_form function must return a value: don’t use print or echo.\nPassword Size Limitation\nMake sure to set the maxlength parameter to a value of 20 when replacing the password protection form as WordPress will only save the first 20 characters due to database constraints.\nProtected Excerpt Text\nThe default Excerpt of a password-protected post is: “There is no excerpt because this is a protected post.” This code will replace that text with your own — HTML allowed:\n<?php\nfunction my_excerpt_protected( $excerpt ) {\n    if ( post_password_required() )\n        $excerpt = '<em>[This is password-protected.]</em>';\n    return $excerpt;\n}\nadd_filter( 'the_excerpt', 'my_excerpt_protected' );\n?>\n\nReplace “<em>[This is password-protected.]</em>” with your custom password-protected Excerpt message.\nAdd the Password Form to the Excerpt\nAnother option for your protected Excerpts is to print out the password form instead of the Excerpt message. That way people enter the password right from an index or archive page. Then, when they click the Title link, they’ll see the Content. With the get_the_password_form function, you can make the password form be the Excerpt for a password-protected post:\n<?php\nfunction my_excerpt_password_form( $excerpt ) {\n    if ( post_password_required() )\n        $excerpt = get_the_password_form();\n    return $excerpt;\n}\nadd_filter( 'the_excerpt', 'my_excerpt_password_form' );\n?>\n\nThis will get the default WordPress password form and text or any customizations you’ve made. For a better understanding of how post_password_required() and get_the_password_form() work, read their function definitions in wp-includes/post-template.php.\nIn this same WordPress core file you’ll also find the the_excerpt and the_password_form filters, and the functions get_the_excerpt(), get_the_title(), and get_the_content(). These functions control how a post’s title, excerpt and content display, depending on its visibility setting.\nHiding Password Protected Posts\nSometimes, you don’t want your password protected posts to show up on other places around your site, like on the home page or archive pages. To effectively hide them from these pages without affecting your pagination, place the following code in your custom plugin file:\n<?php\n\n// Filter to hide protected posts\nfunction exclude_protected($where) {\n\tglobal $wpdb;\n\treturn $where .= \" AND {$wpdb->posts}.post_password = '' \";\n}\n\n// Decide where to display them\nfunction exclude_protected_action($query) {\n\tif( !is_single() && !is_page() && !is_admin() ) {\n\t\tadd_filter( 'posts_where', 'exclude_protected' );\n\t}\n}\n\n// Action to queue the filter at the right time\nadd_action('pre_get_posts', 'exclude_protected_action');\n\n?>\n\nThis code works in two parts: the first part effectively removes any password protected posts directly from any SQL query that WordPress is running, using the posts_where filter. The second part adds this filter to all pages except single posts, pages, and admin pages.\nFor more information on why pre_get_posts is the right action for this function, see the pre_get_posts action reference.\nChanging the cookie lifetime\nSee https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/post_password_expires/\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/protect-posts-with-password/", "title": "Protect posts with password – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Post Visibility Settings Once you publish a WordPress post (or Page), it is visible to the public (by default).

{"text": "\nPosts in WordPress can have one of a number of statuses. The status of a given post determines how WordPress handles that post. For instance, public posts viewable by everyone are assigned the publish status, while drafts are assigned the draft status. The status is stored in the post_status field in the wp_posts table.\nWordPress provides 8 built-in statuses you can use. WordPress 3.0 gave you the capability to add your own custom post status and to use it in different ways.\nWorkflow\nWordPress provides built-in features that empower some users (based on their Roles and Capabilities) to review content submitted to the website before it is published. This is commonly called “workflow.” WordPress’s workflow features rely on the value of a post’s post_status field to know which step in the workflow process the post is currently held in.\nMost users are already familiar with at least two workflow states:\nPosts that are published and visible to everyone (including users who are logged out) are given the publish status.Drafts that are not yet published are assigned the draft status.\nInternally, WordPress sets the post status to publish when you click the “Publish” button, and WordPress sets the post status to draft when you click the “Save Draft” button. Similarly, if your website has users granted the edit_posts capability but not the publish_posts capability, then when those users start writing a new post, WordPress will display a “Submit for Review” button instead of a “Publish” button. Likewise, WordPress then assigns the post that user created the pending status when they press that button.\nThe status of a post can also be set in the Administration Screen and Add New Posts Screen by any user with the capability needed to assign the post to the given status. Internally, all of these posts are stored in the same place (the wp_posts table), and are differentiated by a column called post_status.\nDefault Statuses\nThere are 8 major post statuses that WordPress uses by default.\nPublish\nViewable by everyone. (publish)\nFuture\nScheduled to be published in a future date. (future)\nDraft\nIncomplete post viewable by anyone with proper user role.  (draft)\nPending\nAwaiting a user with the publish_posts capability (typically a user assigned the Editor role) to publish. (pending)\nPrivate\nViewable only to WordPress users at Administrator level. (private)\nTrash\nPosts in the Trash are assigned the trash status. (trash)\nAuto-Draft\nRevisions that WordPress saves automatically while you are editing. (auto-draft)\nInherit\nUsed with a child post (such as Attachments and Revisions) to determine the actual status from the parent post.  (inherit)\nCustom Status\nNOTICE:\n\nThis function does NOT add the registered post status to the Administration Screen.  This functionality is pending future development.  Please refer to Trac Ticket #12706.\n\nConsider the action hook post_submitbox_misc_actions for adding this parameter.\n\n\n\nA Custom Status is a Post Status you define.\nAdding a custom status to WordPress is done via the register_post_status() function.

{"text": "\nTerminology Introduction\nThe developers created WordPress as a weblogging  (blogging) system. A blog, as defined in the Codex Glossary, is “an online journal, diary, or serial, published by a person or group of people”. Many blogs are personal in nature, reflecting the opinions and interests of the owner. But, blogs are now important tools in the world of news, business, politics, and entertainment. \nBlogs are a form of a Content Management System (CMS), which Wikipedia calls “a system used to organize and facilitate collaborative content creation.” Both blogs and Content Management Systems can perform the role of a website (site for short). A website can be thought of as a collection of articles and information about a specific subject, service, or product, which may not be a personal reflection of the owner. More recently, as the role of WordPress has expanded, WordPress developers have begun using the more general term site, in place of blog.\nContent Terminology\nThe term Word in WordPress refers to the words used to compose posts. Posts are the principal element (or content) of a blog. The posts are the writings, compositions, discussions, discourses, musings, and, yes, the rantings of the blog’s owner and guest authors. Posts, in most cases, are the reason a blog exists; without posts, there is no blog! \nIntegral to a blog are the pictures, images, sounds, and movies, otherwise know as media. Media enhances, and gives life to a blog’s content. WordPress provides an easy to use method of inserting Media directly into posts, and a method to upload Media that can be later attached to posts, and a Media Library to manage those various Media. \nAn important part of the posting process is the act of assigning those posts to categories. Each post in WordPress is filed under one or more categories. Categories can be hierarchical in nature, where one category acts as a parent to several child, or grandchild, categories. Thoughtful categorization allows posts of similar content to be grouped, thereby aiding viewers in the navigation, and use of a site. In addition to categories, terms or keywords called tags can be assigned to each post. Tags act as another navigation tool, but are not hierarchical in nature. Both categories and tags are part of a system called taxonomies. If categories and tags are not enough, users can also create custom taxonomies that allow more specific identification of posts or pages or custom post types. \nIn turn, post categories and tags are two of the elements of what’s called post meta data. Post meta data refers to the information associated with each post and includes the author’s name and the date posted as well as the post categories. Post meta data also refers to Custom Fields where you assign specific words, or keys, that can describe posts. But, you can’t mention post meta data without discussing the term meta. \nGenerally, meta means “information\nabout”; in WordPress, meta usually refers to administrative-type\ninformation. So, besides post meta data, Meta is the HTML tag used to describe\nand define a web page to the outside world, like meta tag keywords for\nsearch engines. Also, many WordPress-based sites offer a Meta section,\nusually found in the sidebar, with links to login or register at that site. And,\ndon’t forget Meta Rules: The rules defining the general protocol to follow in\nusing this Codex, or Meta, as in the MediaWiki namespace that refers to\nadministrative functions within Codex. That’s a lot of Meta! \nAfter a post\nis made public, a blog’s readers will respond, via comments, to that post, and in\nturn, authors will reply. Comments enable the communication process,\nthat give-and-take, between author and reader. Comments are the\nlife-blood of most blogs. \nFinally, WordPress also offers two other content management tools called Pages and custom post types. Pages often present static information, such as “About Me”, or “Contact Us”, Pages. Typically “timeless” in nature, Pages should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called posts. Interestingly, a Page is allowed to be commented upon, but a Page cannot be categorized. A custom post type refers to a type of structured data that is different from a post or a page. Custom post types allow users to easily create and manage such things as portfolios, projects, video libraries, podcasts, quotes, chats, and whatever a user or developer can imagine. \nDesign Terminology\nA WordPress\nTheme is the overall design of a site and encompasses color, graphics, and\ntext. A Theme is sometimes called the skin or template, but it\nisn’t really. A skin and template are really website paint jobs. A WordPress\nTheme is where code meets design, allowing a site to change based upon specific\nconditions set by the site administrator. \nInstallation of WordPress Themes is made easy with the Themes Menu on the Administration Screens. Simply search for a new Theme from within the official WordPress Theme Directory and activate it with a few clicks. You can also preview your site before installing and activating the Theme to see what your site will look like with that WordPress Theme. \nThe flexibility of WordPress is apparent when discussing terminology related to the design of a WordPress site. At the core of WordPress, developers created a programming structure named The Loop to handle the processing of posts. The Loop is the critical PHP program code used to display posts. Anyone wanting to enhance and customize WordPress will need to understand the mechanics of The Loop. \nAlong with The Loop, WordPress developers have created Template Tags which are a group of PHP functions that can be invoked by designers to perform an action or display specific information. It is the Template Tags that form the basis of the Template Files. Templates (files) contain the programming pieces, such as Template Tags, that control the structure and flow of a WordPress site. These files draw information from your WordPress MySQL database and generate the HTML code which is sent to the web browser. A Template Hierarchy, in essence the order of processing, dictates how Templates control almost all aspects of the output, including Headers, Sidebars, and Archives. Archives are a dynamically generated list of posts, and are typically grouped by date, category, tag, or author. \nAs the\ncapabilities of WordPress have improved, developers have added tools that allow\nusers to easily manage a site’s look and functionality: \nWidgets provide an easy way to add little programs, such as the current weather, to a sidebar. Menus make it easy to define the navigation buttons that are typically present near the top of a site’s pages. The Background tool allows the user to change the background image and color of a site.The Header tool gives the user control of the images displayed at the top of a site’s various pages.      Post Formats allow the user to control the display of a specific post (i.e. display this post as an Aside or as a quote or as a gallery). \nPlugins are custom functions created to extend the core functionality of WordPress. The WordPress developers have maximized flexibility and minimized code bloat by allowing outside developers the opportunity to create their own useful add-on features. As evidenced by the WordPress Plugin Directory, there’s a Plugin to enhance virtually every aspect of WordPress. \nA Plugin management tool makes it extremely easy\nto find and install Plugins directly from the official directory. \nAdministrative Terminology\nAnother set of terms to examine are those involving the Administration of a WordPress site. A comprehensive set of Administration Screens enables users to easily administer and monitor their blog. A WordPress administrator has a number of powers which include requiring a visitor to register in order to participate in the blog, who can create new posts, whether comments can be left, and if files can be uploaded to the blog. \nSome of the main administrative responsibilities of a WordPress blog involve adding, deleting, and managing Registered Users. Administering users means controlling Roles and Capabilities, or permissions. Roles control what functions a registered user can perform as those functions can range from just being able to login at a blog to performing the role administrator. \nAnother chief concern for the blog administrator is Comment Moderation. Comments, also called discussions, are responses to posts left for the post author by the visitor and represent an important part of “the give and take” of a blog. But Comments must be patrolled for Spam and other malicious intentions. The WordPress Administration Comments Screen simplifies that process with easy-to-use screens which add, change, and delete Comments. \nAnd not to be forgotten is the obligation for an administrator to keep their WordPress current to insure that the latest features, bugs, and security fixes are in effect. To accommodate administrators, WordPress has a simple Upgrade Screen to download and install the latest version of WordPress. There’s no excuse to not upgrade! \nHelp Terminology\nThe final set of jargon relates to helping you with WordPress. First and foremost is the hanging Help tab that is displayed under each of the Administration Screens. That contextual help describes the function and use of the current screen and provides links to other help topics. And, there are other help resources available to WordPress users; Finding WordPress Help, Troubleshooting, and WordPress FAQ (frequently asked questions) are good starting points. Also Getting Started with WordPress will jump-start readers into the world of WordPress and the excellent WordPress Lessons provide in-depth tutorials on many of the aspects of using WordPress. Among the most important resources is the WordPress Support Forum where knowledgeable volunteers answer your questions and help solve any problems related to WordPress. And, of course, this Support site which is filled with hundreds of articles designed to make your WordPress experience a success! \nMore Information\nand Resources\nSee Also\nThe WordPress GlossaryWordPress FeaturesWordPress Support Forum\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-semantics/", "title": "WordPress semantics – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Terminology Introduction The developers created WordPress as a weblogging  (blogging) system.

{"text": "\nDescription\nThe WordPress revisions system stores a record of each saved draft or published update. The revision system allows you to see what changes were made in each revision by dragging a slider (or using the Next/Previous buttons). The display indicates what has changed in each revision – what was added, what remained unchanged, and what was removed. Lines added or removed are highlighted, and individual character changes get additional highlighting. Click the ‘Restore This Revision’ button to restore a revision.\nThe revisions page also includes a ‘compare any two revisions’ mode that allows you to compare any two individual revisions. In this mode, the slider has two handles, one representing the revision you are comparing from and one representing the revision you are comparing to. Drag the handles to see what has changed between any two specific revisions. Note: the ‘Restore This Revision’ button always restores the revision you are comparing to.\nTo return to the post edit screen without restoring a revision, click on the post title at the top of the page.\nAutosaves\nThere is only ever a maximum of one autosave per user for any given post. New autosaves overwrite old autosaves. This means that no, your tables do not grow by one row every 60 seconds. In multi-user settings, one autosave is stored for each user.\nAutosaves are enabled for all posts and pages but do not overwrite published content. Autosaves are stored as a special type of revision; they do not overwrite the actual post. In fact, whether your power goes out, your browser crashes, or you lose your internet connection, when you go back to edit that post, WP will toss up a warning telling you that it has a backup of your post and a link to restore the backup. When reviewing revisions, autosaves are clearly marked.\nRevision Options\nLimit the number of posts revisions that WordPress stores in the database.\nThe wp_revisions_to_keep filter allows developers to easily alter how many revisions are kept for a given post.\nAlternately, the limit can be set in wp-config.php:\ndefine( 'WP_POST_REVISIONS', 3 );\n\nWP_POST_REVISIONS:\ntrue (default), -1: store every revisionfalse, 0: do not store any revisions (except the one autosave per post)(int) > 0: store that many revisions (+1 autosave) per post. Old revisions are automatically deleted.\nRevision Storage Method\nRevisions are stored in the posts table.\nRevisions are stored as children of their associated post (the same thing we do for attachments). They are given a post_status of ‘inherit’, a post_type of ‘revision’, and a post_name of {parent ID}- revision(-#) for regular revisions and {parent ID}-autosave for autosaves.\nBy default, WP keeps track of the changes to title, author, content, excerpt.\nRevision Management\nDeleting: There is an API function to delete revisions, but there is no UI. That can certainly change.\nDisplaying Rendered Revisions\nCurrently revision comparison “diffs” are rendered in Text (or HTML) view; proposed filters would allow plugin developers to customize diff encoding/rendering.

{"text": "\nGetting a WordPress Tune Up\nTo keep WordPress working healthy, there is some site maintenance we recommend you do frequently.\nBegin by creating a calendar of WordPress Maintenance procedures to remind yourself to get a maintenance job on your WordPress site on a regular basis.\nIn the article on WordPress Housekeeping, tips and resources are given to clean house in WordPress. These include cleaning out old plugins, upgrading WordPress, and other helpful tips for cleaning up and optimizing your WordPress Site.\nTo ensure you keep your WordPress site up-to-date and working in prime condition, consider adding these Housekeeping steps to your calendar, typically every three to six months.\nUpdate WordPress\nWordPress is quickly growing and expanding as more features and functions are included and perfected. It is recommended that you check in with WordPress for updates and upgrades at least every three months, six months at the most. Check WordPress org and Download WordPress for information on the latest version available.\nNote: For WordPress 3.7+, minor and security updates are automatically applied in the background process.\nCheck for Dead Links\nOne of the most complained about aspect of using the Internet is the dead link. This is a link on a page or search engine that goes nowhere. It results in the 404 Page Error – Page Not Found. These can come from links to external sites that have changed their address or closed, or it can come from internal links. When you link between posts in your post articles, you might have misspelled a permalink address or put in the wrong post-ID, resulting in a page not found on your site. If you’ve recently made a change in your permalink structure, you might have some 404 page errors that might need cleaning up.\nAdd to your WordPress maintenance list regularly scheduled visits to your site’s statistic logs to check on reports of 404 errors on your site, and take time to run a links check on your external, and internal, links to make sure everything is still connected. Dependent upon the site and number of links on your site, you should check your site for dead links every six months to a year.\nW3C free check link free utilityAnyBrowser’s Link CheckerHTMLHelp Valet Link CheckerSquarefree’s Bookmarklets – javascripts for checking linksKeepNI’s link check (14 day evaluation, $299.00 US)\nCheck In With WordPress\nThe WordPress Dashboard, part of the Administration Screens, help to keep you up-to-date on the WordPress Community and activities, but check the WordPress website to find out if there have been any upgrades, news, events, or information you may need to know as a WordPress user.\nIf you aren’t an active participant in the WordPress Forums, check in once in a while to see what is going on and what topics are being discussed. There might be a topic that might interest you or news you should know.\nAlso visit the WordPress Documentation here to find out if there is new documentation, events, information, or resources that will help you better run and manage your WordPress site.\nDelete Spam Comments\nIf you are using one of the many different Comment Spam WordPress Plugins with your WordPress blog, spam can collect in your database. Comment spam is stored in the database as a “just in case” so you can restore a comment incorrectly marked at comment spam. It also serves as a resource to track down recurrent comment spammers, if you need to.\nIn general, while some plugins will delete comment spam from your database after a specific period of time, not all do. These entries are dead-weight and unnecessary, and they can accumulate. To delete all current comment spam entries run this query on your WordPress database with phpMyAdmin in the SQL page:\nDELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = 'spam'\nBack It Up\nMake it a part of your regularly scheduled maintenance to backup your WordPress site, both on the website host server and on your computer. For detailed information see WordPress Backups. Consider scheduling this, depending upon the volume of new posts or articles you add to your site, three to twelve times a year.\nBacking Up Your Database describes how to save a backup copy of your database tables that contain all your blog data, and Restoring Your Database From Backup guides you through the process of restoring data using one of your backups should you ever have to do so.\nUpdate Your Site\nIf you haven’t been adding posts or articles lately, make a schedule to remind you to add new material on a regular basis. If you have, then take a look at what you’ve posted in the past and maybe do a little checking for proper grammar, bad spelling, information that needs updating, rewriting and editing a little, checking for any adjustments that should be made to make the information you’ve released to the public better.\nWebsite looks change with time and maybe you are tired of your old look. It might need a little tweaking to improve its presentation and performance, or maybe it’s time for a new WordPress Theme.\nSchedule site updates, depending upon how frequently you post new posts and articles, about every six months so your site will stay fresh and alive.\nValidate Again\nMake it a website maintenance policy to validate your site after making any code or style sheet changes. This way, you can keep on top of guaranteeing users won’t run into problems and trouble that might be brewing under the surface.\nYou can also regularly schedule validation tests on your site to keep it in top working condition and keep up with any changes or deprecations of the CSS and HTML standards. Typically, this should be done about once a year or when you make significant modifications to your site.\nOther Maintenance Tasks\nFor the serious blogger or website administrator, there are some site maintenance tasks you should do to keep up with your site based on site statistics data so that it improves hit ratio from search engine. Here are some suggestions to keep your site in top shape.\nCheck Your Website Statistics : Who is visiting, where they are visiting from, which pages are the most visited…check in regularly with your website statistics to find out where the action is on your site, where the dead links are, and where users are coming from. This information can help you better fine tune your site to meet the needs of your users and increase your web visibility. You should check site statistics at least monthly if you have an active site.Check Your Linkability : There are many link popularity tools on the Internet that will check to see who is linking to you. This is part of the puzzle that search engines use to rank your site. Dependent upon your site’s activity and need to grow in search engine rankings, this should be done monthly, or at least three times a year.Site Submissions : If you have a desire to make your site rise in search engine rankings, regularly schedule activity surrounding your site’s submissions to search engines and attracting new users. Take care to limit your submissions to the same search engine too frequently, as that can penalize you, but check in with your site submissions once or twice a year at a minimum.Update Advertising : If you have included advertising in your site, check with your advertisers on a regular basis to make sure they haven’t changed their techniques, pricing, and process. Dependent upon site activity, this could be as often as once a month or several times a year.\nSite Maintenance Calendar\nWe’ve put together a sample calendar for your site maintenance to help you schedule time to keep your WordPress site tuned up and running smoothly.\nJanuaryUpgrade or Update WordPressCheck in with WordPressAdd New ContentFebruaryAdd New ContentCheck for new PluginsClean out PluginsBackup Database and SiteCheck Site StatisticsCheck Site’s Link Popularity and Search Engine RankingMarchClean up and/or Try New ThemeCheck in with WordPressAdd New ContentAprilClean Out Graphics and PhotographsAdd New ContentBackup Database and SiteCheck Site StatisticsSubmit Site to Search EnginesMayCheck for Dead LinksCheck in with WordPressAdd New ContentJuneBackup Database and SiteAdd New ContentCheck Site StatisticsCheck Site’s Link Popularity and Search Engine RankingCheck AdvertisingJulyUpgrade or Update WordPressCheck in with WordPressAdd New ContentAugustCheck for New PluginsClean Out Old PluginsBackup Database and SiteAdd New ContentCheck Site StatisticsSeptemberClean or Renew ThemesCheck in with WordPressAdd New ContentSubmit Site to Search EnginesCheck AdvertisingOctoberBackup Database and SiteValidate Web Pages and CSSOptimize Web Pages and CSSAdd New ContentCheck Site StatisticsNovemberCheck in with WordPressAdd New ContentCheck Site’s Link Popularity and Search Engine RankingDecemberBackup Database and SiteCheck Site StatisticsAdd New ContentCheck Advertising\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-site-maintenance/", "title": "WordPress Site Maintenance – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Getting a WordPress Tune Up To keep WordPress working healthy, there is some site maintenance we recommend you do frequently.

Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options. These options are saved so that you can customize how your own editing screen looks. So if modules such as Custom Fields, Discussion, Slug and Post Author are hidden from view use the Screen Options to expose those modules.\nExpanding, collapsing, and rearranging, modules\nThe modules, Publish, Page Attribute, Features Image and others, can be expanded, or collapsed, by clicking on the module title bar.\nIn addition, those modules can be moved by hovering the mouse cursor over the module title bar, when the mouse cursor changes to 4-arrows, hold the left-mouse button down, drag the module to where you want to place it, then release the mouse button (this is called drag-and-drop).\nAdd new page\nTitle \nThe title of your page. You can use any words or phrases. Avoid using the same title twice as that will cause problems. You can use commas, apostrophes, quotes, hypens/dashes, and other typical symbols in the page like “About My Site – Here’s Lookin’ at You, Kid.” WordPress will clean it up for the link to the page, called the slug.\nPage editing area \nThe blank box where you enter your writing, links, links to images, and any information you want to display on your site. You can use either the Visual or the Text view to compose your posts. For more on the Text view, see the Visual Versus Text View article.\nPreview button \nAllows you to view the page before officially publishing it.\nPublish box \nContains buttons that control the state of your page. The main states are Published, Pending Review, and Draft. A Published status means the page has been published on your blog for all to see. Pending Review means the draft is waiting for review by an editor prior to publication. Draft means the page has not been published and remains a draft for you. If you select a specific publish status and click the update page or Publish button, that status is applied to the page. For example, to save a page in the Pending Review status, click Edit link of Status and select Pending Review from the drop-down box, click OK to close the drop-down box and click Save As Pending button. (You will see all pages organized by status by going to Pages > All Pages). To schedule a page for publication on a future time or date, click “Edit” in the Publish area next to the words “Publish immediately”. You can also change the publish date to a date in the past to back-date pages. Change the settings to the desired time and date. You must also hit the “Publish” button when you have completed the page to publish at the desired time and date.\nVisibility – This determines how your page appears to the world. Public pages will be visible by all website visitors once published. Password Protected pages are published to all, but visitors must know the password to view the page content. Private pages are visible only to you (and to other editors or admins within your site)\nPermalink \nAfter you save your page, the Permalink below the title shows the potential URL for the page, as long as you have permalinks enabled. (To enable permalinks, go to Settings > Permalinks.) The URL is generated from your title. In previous versions of WordPress, this was referred to as the “page-slug.” The commas, quotes, apostrophes, and other non-HTML favorable characters are changed and a dash is put between each word. If your title is “My Site – Here’s Lookin’ at You, Kid”, it will be cleaned up to be “my-site-heres-lookin-at-you-kid” as the title. You can manually change this, maybe shortening it to “my-site-lookin-at-you-kid”.\nSave \nAllows you to save your page as a draft / pending review rather than immediately publishing it.

{"text": "\nThe Appearance Themes Screen allows you to manage your Themes. That means you can install, preview, delete Themes, activate, and update Themes.\n\nA WordPress Theme is a collection of files that work together to  produce a graphical interface with an underlying unifying design for a  weblog. These files are called template files.  A Theme modifies the way the site is displayed, without modifying the  underlying software. Themes may include customized template files, image  files (*.jpg, *.gif), style sheets (*.css), custom Pages, as well as any necessary code files (*.php).  \nManage Themes\nCurrent Theme\nThe current active Theme appears first in the upper left corner.

This is the easiest way to install a Theme.\nVisit Administration > Appearance > Themes, click the Add New button. You can find additional themes for your site from the WordPress Theme Directory.  These themes are designed and developed by third parties, are available  free of charge, and are compatible with the license WordPress uses. \nUse one of three Search methods to find the desired Theme:\n\n Filter search – at the top of the screen select one of three  filters, Featured, Popular, or Latest. When you find a theme you like,  you can preview it or install it. Keyword search – Enter keyword, author, or tag. The search results will be updated as you type. Attribute search – Click Feature Filter link to get more specific  and search by categorized criteria. Select multiple criteria and click  Apply Filters button.\nThemes Features Search \nOnce you have generated a list of themes, you can preview and install\n any of them. Click on the thumbnail of the theme you’re interested in\npreviewing. It will open up in a full-screen Preview page to give you a\nbetter idea of how that theme will look.\n\nTo install the theme so you can preview it with your site’s  content and customize its theme options, click the “Install” button at  the top of the left-hand pane. The theme files will be downloaded to  your website automatically. When this is complete, the theme is now  available for activation, which you can do by clicking the “Activate”  link. Or you may click “Live Preview” or “Return to Theme Installer”.\nInstalling a theme (Upload Method)\nUsing the upload method\nThe upload method is another easy way to install a Theme. This can be  used to install any Theme that is in a ZIP file. All the Themes in the WordPress Theme Directory can be installed using this method. Download the ZIP file. First find the Theme you want to install. Other sources of Themes can be used and  the key is to download the Theme ZIP file to your local computer. Place  the file anywhere convenient. \nVisit Administration > Appearance > Themes, click the Add New button, then click the Upload Theme link. Click Browse button and specify the ZIP file you downloaded in above step and click Install Now. \nThe Install Theme from uploaded file will display the results of the installation. Click the Activate link to make that the Current Theme. \nUsing the FTP method\n Download the Theme files to your local computer. If the Theme  is in ZIP file archive and extract the ZIP file contents to a folder on  your local computer. You may need to preserve the directory structure in  the archive when extracting these files. Follow the guidelines provided  by your Theme author. Using an FTP client to access your host web server. If necessary create a directory to contain your Theme in the /wp-content/themes directory provided by WordPress. For example, a Theme named Test should be in /wp-content/themes/test. Your Theme may provide this directory as part of the archive. Upload the Theme files to the new directory on your host server. Visit Administration > Appearance > Themes,  if necessary navigate to the page displaying that Theme, then click the Activate link to make the Theme, the Current Theme.\nInstalling with cPanel\nIf your host offers the cPanel control panel, and the Theme files are in a .zip or .gz archive follow these instructions.  \n Download the Theme ZIP file to your local machine. In cPanel File Manager, navigate to your Themes folder. If you have  WordPress installed in it’s own folder called wordpress, you would  navigate to “public_html/wordpress/wp-content/themes” and if WordPress  is installed in your web-root folder you would navigate to  “public_html/wp-content/themes”. Once you’ve navigated to the Themes folder in cPanel File Manager,  click on Upload file(s) and upload that ZIP file you saved in Step 1.Once the ZIP file is uploaded, click on the ZIP file name in cPanel,  then in the panel to the right, click on Extract File Contents, and  that ZIP file will be uncompressed.

Here is a list of things you should do on a regularly scheduled basis to keep your WordPress site running smoothly.\nUpgrade WordPress\nIf a new release of WordPress is out, we recommend that you upgrade. These new releases often include new and improved features and fixes. It is recommended to check in with WordPress for updates and upgrades at least every three months, six months at the most. Check WordPress.org or WordPress Downloads for latest version available.\nPlugins\nPlugins are an exciting feature of WordPress. They add functions and features to your WordPress site such as adding customized post listings to featuring a local weather forecast on your site.\nWith the hundreds of plugins available, it’s fun to test drive them, trying out different ones to see what they will do, if you need them, and if they really add to your site or clutter things up. Once in a while, you should do a little housekeeping on your plugins.\nUpgrade Plugins\nEvery three to six months, check for the latest plugin version. This is easy to do from the Administration > Plugin Screen. If an update is available, WordPress will notify you with a banner below the plugin. Just click the “upgrade automatically” link, or click the “Download” link if you would prefer to upgrade manually.\nAdministration Plugins Screen\nDelete Old or Unwanted Plugins\nTo uninstall a WordPress Plugin:\nGo to Plugins screen.Find the Plugin you wish to deactivate and uninstall.Click Deactivate.Click Delete.\nThe Plugin will initiate the deactivation and deletion.\nMost WordPress Plugins have an option to completely uninstall themselves, though not all. If you wish to remove a WordPress Plugin permanently:\nCheck the WordPress Plugin instructions in the Details readme file on how to properly uninstall the Plugin.If the WordPress Plugin required the addition of code to the WordPress Theme, manually edit the Theme files to remove it.Deactivate the Plugin and remove it manually through your FTP program.Login to the site via your FTP Program.Go to the Plugin directory and find where the Plugin is installed.Delete the WordPress Plugin folder and/or files from your server.\nNew Plugins\nWordPress plugins are being added constantly. Every three to six months search the Internet or visit the WordPress plugins repository to see if there are any new plugins available that will improve your site. There might be a new plugin that will do what one of your older plugins do. \nTheme Housekeeping\nJust like plugins, many users love test driving all the different WordPress Themes available. Some users might have twenty or more Themes in their theme list. If you aren’t using them, why not do a little housekeeping on your themes?\nAppearance Themes Screen\nTo remove a theme from your WordPress site:\nLog in to the WordPress Administration Screen.Select the Appearance screen then Themes.Select Theme Details for the theme you want to remove.Select Delete near the bottom-right corner.\nGet a New Theme\nTired of your old theme’s look? Maybe it’s time to do a little presentation housekeeping and change the look of your WordPress site. Thanks to WordPress’s support for themes, changing your site’s look is easy.\nCheck out the various resources for WordPress Themes. If you find one you like, install it and then activate it.\nDon’t worry, your old theme will still be there. Test drive the new one for a while. You can always go back to the old one. If you are really determined to turn your theme housekeeping efforts into some serious work, check out the article on Theme Development to create your own unique theme.\nUnwanted Images\nMany users upload a lot of graphics to their site that they end up never using. If you find yourself with a lot of unused graphics and images, consider going through them and cleaning house by deleting them.\nIf you aren’t sure you will never need them again, but you aren’t using them now and want to remove them from your site if server site space is limited, move them to a folder in your hard drive WordPress folder called backupimages or something similar and store them there, just in case.\nDatabase Optimization\nOver time, your WordPress database can generate what’s called “overhead.” This condition is similar to a defragmented hard drive. There are some plugins that optimize your database (e.g. WP-Sweep) \nMaintenance Schedule\nIn the article, Lessons: WordPress Site Maintenance, we cover website maintenance, but take a moment now to go through this list of WordPress housekeeping chores and add them to your calendar so you can clean up your site on a regular basis, keeping your WordPress site a lean and clean site to visit.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-housekeeping/", "title": "WordPress Housekeeping – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Cleaning Your WordPress House Just as with your house, WordPress requires a little housekeeping once in a while to keep it working right.

{"text": "\nWordPress help is never hard to find. There are many sites dedicated to helping WordPress users, including this support page and the always-helpful forums. With so much content available, however, how are you to know where to begin looking for help?\nThe WordPress FAQ, which provides comprehensive answers to common questions, is a good place to start. You could also read our document on using the WordPress forums to help you get better results from your support requests.\nHowever, the best place to start looking for WordPress help is your favorite search engine. This is usually the quickest way to get the information you need, and helps take some of the pressure off our volunteers in the support forums.\nSearching The Net For WordPress Help\nWhen searching online for WordPress help, one of the biggest challenges can be figuring out the right keywords to use. Otherwise, you risk spending an inordinate amount of time sorting through search results that don’t accurately reflect the problem that you are currently experiencing. In order to quickly get the information that you need, it makes sense to limit your search to specific online WordPress resources or websites. The following section will show you how to choose the right search terms, and how to use those terms effectively.\nSearch Using Keywords\nSometimes you can use error messages to generate the keywords needed in your help search. For example:\nWarning: main(/home/atlantis/public_html/wp-includes/\nfunctions.php): failed to open stream: No such\nfile or directory in /home/stargateatlantis/\npublic_html/wp-settings.php on line 67\n\nFatal error: main(): Failed opening required\n'/home/atlantis/public_html/wp-includes/\nfunctions.php' (include_path='.:/usr/lib/php:\n/usr/local/lib/php') in /home/stargateatlantis/\npublic_html/wp-settings.php on line 67\nThe keywords you need to help solve the problem are hidden within this information. In particular, the error specifically references the files that are causing the issue: functions.php and wp-settings.php. The names of these files will make up part of your search.\nYou could try opening the files directly to examine them. However, this may be of limited use. Due to the way that WordPress processes .php files, the given line numbers may not correspond to the actual source of the error.\nThe specific errors are failed to open stream and failed opening required, with both happening inside the wp-settings.php file. This indicates that the problem is likely with wp-settings.php rather than functions.php. The fact that both errors contain the words “failed” and “open” is another clue.\nArmed with this information, create a search in your favorite search engine that includes the words:\nwordpress failed open wp-settings.php\n\nThis should get you started on narrowing down the problem.\nNot all keywords can be found so easily. If the problem is a CSS or HTML issue, you can include the specific tag or selector with which the problem seems to lie. However, it is still advisable to include actual words in your search, as it can be difficult to figure out which tag is causing the actual issue.\nYou may need to analyze the problem for a minute or two to in order to find the right terms. For example, if your web page layout looks noticeably different in Internet Explorer than it does in another browser, then search for information on Internet Explorer layout bugs. On the other hand, if you have a layout error that remains consistent among browsers, identify the part of the layout that is affected. Is it the sidebar, header, post content, or comments? Likewise, if the header image is not showing up or is not displaying correctly, begin by searching for wordpress header image and then add specifics such as wordpress header image missing to narrow things down.\nBrainstorming Search Terms\nBrainstorming is a useful technique to use if you are struggling to find suitable keywords. To start, write down the problem you are experiencing, trying to be as descriptive as possible. For example:\nI’m having trouble with the nested list in the sidebar of my layout. It isn’t lining up the items under the titles right. It is keeping things on the left margin when I want them to be indented.\nYour description can be a good source of potential keywords. In the above example, you can find:\nsidebarlayoutnested listleft marginindented\nAll of these terms could be used as search keywords.\nAlternatively, explain your problem to a non-WordPress user. Stating the issue in simple terms is an excellent way to get to the heart of a problem and find the right keywords to summarize the issue.\nSearch Engine Site Search\nOnce you have selected your keywords, it’s time to put them to work. As you sort through the search results, you may end up replacing your initial keywords with more specific ones, in order to narrow down the results. For example, while searching for “wordpress sidebar layout nested links”, you may discover that the problem lies within the specific theme you are using. Add the name of the theme to your keywords in order to narrow down your search.\nAnother way to improve the quality of your search results is to search a specific site, rather than the entire internet. Most search engines allow you to run a search across one specific web address, helping you to avoid irrelevant results.\nGoogle, Yahoo, and Bing Site Search\nGoogle, Yahoo, and Bing all support use of the “site:” function while searching. To search a specific domain via one of these search engines, type your keywords and specify the site you want to search using the format “site:[domain]”. For example:\nkeyword1 keyword2 site:wordpress.org\n\nThis instructs the search engine to search all wordpress.org sites, such as codex.wordpress.org, wordpress.org/support, and make.wordpress.org.\nTo narrow your search down to a specific site, such as codex.wordpress.org, enter:\nkeyword1 keyword2 site:codex.wordpress.org\n\nThis instructs the search engine to search only the codex.wordpress.org site, which won’t include results from the Support Forums.\nOther Search Engines\nOther search engines provide different ways to narrow down searches. Check to see if there is an advanced search option for your favorite search engine, and take your search from there.\nUse Quotes to Group Keywords\nYou can narrow your search by grouping different keywords together. For example, instead of looking for:\nsidebar layout nested list left margin indented\nyou could group key phrases together with quote marks:\nsidebar layout \"nested list\" \"left margin\" indented\nThis would limit your search to anything with the words sidebar, layout, and indented, and the phrases “nested list” and “left margin.”\nMost search engines also allow you to use Boolean references such as AND, OR and NOT to group keywords together. For example, searching for:\n\"left margin\" OR \"nested list\"\nwould return a list of pages containing either the phrase “left margin” or “nested list”, as well as pages containing both of those terms.\nWordPress Sources for Help\nThe best way to find accurate and concise WordPress information is to get it directly from WordPress.org sites. The main places to go for WordPress help and support are:\nWordPress Codex – WordPress Online ManualWordPress Support ForumsIRC Libera WordPress Support on channel #wordpressWordPress IRC Live Help\nOther Helpful Resources\nSearch the WordPress Support Forums for the self-hosted version of WordPress, and the WordPress.com Support Forum for help with WordPress.com issues.

{"text": "\nThis document is designed to offer definitions of various terms, exclusive to WordPress, that users may not be familiar with.\nIf you are a contributor, please don’t add definitions for generic terms (API, PHP, JavaScript, etc…).\nAbsolute Path\n(also known as a full path)\n\nThe complete location of a file or directory within a computer filesystem.  An absolute path starts at the root directory (or drive letter) and continues up the directory hierarchy until the specific file or directory is reached.  This contrasts with a relative path, which does not start at the root directory.\nThe syntax of absolute paths differs by operating system. On Microsoft Windows, they begin with a drive letter and use a backslash to separate directory names. Absolute paths on macOS and Linux lack drive letters and use a forward slash as the directory separator.\nExamples:\n\n Windows: C:\\Users\\Matt\\www\\blog\\images\\icecream.jpg macOS: /Users/Matt/www/blog/images/icecream.jpg Linux: /home/Matt/www/blog/images/icecream.jpg\nTo find the absolute filesystem path of the directory containing a web page, copy the code below into a new text file, save the file as path.php (thus making a simple PHP web page), and move that file to your web server. Then direct your web browser to the URL address of that file (e.g. http://www.example.com/path.php).\n<?php\necho getcwd();\n?>\n\nSee also: Path (computing) at Wikipedia\n\nAbsolute URI\n(also known as a full URI)\n\nA URI that contains the complete location of a resource (as opposed to a relative URI).\nExamples:\n\n http://www.example.com/blog/images/icecream.jpg ftp://ftp.example.com/users/h/harriet/www/\nAction\nIn WordPress; an Action is a PHP function that is executed at specific points throughout the WordPress Core.\n\nDevelopers can create a custom Action using the Action API to add or remove code from an existing Action by specifying any existing Hook. This process is called “hooking“.\n\nFor example: A developer may want to add code to the footer of a Theme. This could be accomplished by writing new function, then Hooking it to the wp_footer Action.\n\nCustom Actions differ from custom Filters because custom Actions allow you to add or remove code from existing Actions. Whereas custom Filters allow you to replace specific data (such as a variable) found within an existing Action.\n See also: Filter, Hook, Terminology Confusion Related articles: Actions, Action Reference, add_action() Forum posts: Filters vs. Actions Discussion and Explanation\nAdmin Bar\nAn area of the screen just above your site that gives you quick\naccess to features such as adding a new post or editing your profile.\nIt is only visible if you are logged in.\n\nThe admin bar concept was added to WordPress in Version 3.1 and was replaced by the Toolbar in WordPress Version 3.3.  To turn it on (or off), open the Dashboard and navigate to Administration > Users > Your Profile.\n Related articles: Toolbar See also: Your Profile Screen\nAjax\nAjax is a technique that web pages use to have the server perform certain processing without reloading the web page. For example, when you approve a comment in a WordPress blog, WordPress uses Ajax to change the comment’s status, and you see the change without having to reload the Comments screen.\n Related article: AJAX External link: AJAX (Wikipedia)\nApache\nApache is short for Apache HTTP Server Project, a robust, commercial-grade, featureful, and freely-available open source HTTP Web server software produced by the Apache Software Foundation. It is the most commonly used web server on the internet, and is available on many platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux, and Mac OS X. Apache serves as a great foundation for publishing WordPress-powered sites.\nAPI\nPlease refer to Wikipedia page for a definition. \nArray\nAn array is one of the basic data structures used in computer programming.  An array contains a list (or vector) of items such as numeric or string values.  Arrays allow programmers to randomly access data.  Data can be stored in either one-dimensional or multi-dimensional arrays.\n\nA one-dimension array seven (7) elements would be:\n\n105200545310213405\n\nThe Template Tag wp_list_categories() uses a one-dimensional array for the ‘exclude’ parameter.\n\nAn example of two-dimensional array, 7 by 3 elements in size, would be:\n\n105200545310213405\n1521014513223134512\n501500499488552751952\n\n External links: Array Programming at Wikipedia, Array at freedictionary.com\nASCII\nASCII (pronounced as “ask ee”) is a standard but limited character set containing only English letters, numbers, a few common symbols, and common English punctuation marks. WordPress content is not restricted to ASCII, but can include any Unicode characters.\nASCII is short for American Standard Code for Information Interchange.\n\n External links: ASCII (Wikipedia, with character set table)\nAtom\nA format for syndicating content on news-like sites, viewable by Atom-aware programs called news readers or aggregators.\n\n See also: News reader, RSS, RDF External links: Atom (standard) at Wikipedia\nAttribute sources\nAn object describing the attributes shape of a block. The keys can be named as most appropriate to describe the state of a block type. The value for each key is a function which describes the strategy by which the attribute value should be extracted from the content of a saved post’s content. When processed, a new object is created, taking the form of the keys defined in the attribute sources, where each value is the result of the attribute source function.\nAttributes\nThe object representation of the current state of a block in post content. When loading a saved post, this is determined by the attribute sources for the block type. These values can change over time during an editing session when the user modifies a block, and are used when determining how to serialize the block.\nAutosave\nWhen you are writing or editing your posts and pages, the changes you\n make are automatically saved every 2 minutes. In the lower right corner\n of the editor, you’ll see a notification of when the entry was last\nsaved to the database.\nAutosaves are automatically enabled for all posts and pages. There is\nonly one autosave for each post/page. Each new autosave overwrites the\nprevious autosave in the database.\n\n Related articles: Revision Management External links: WordPress.com Support – Autosave\nAvatar\nAn avatar is a graphic image or picture that represents a user.\n\n See also: Gravatar Related articles: Using Gravatars External links: Avatar (computing) at Wikipedia\nBack End\nThe back end is the area that authorized users can sign into to add,\nremove and modify content on the website. This may also be referred to\nas “WordPress”, “admin” or “the administration area”.\n\nBinaries\nBinaries refer to compiled computer programs, or executables. Many open source projects, which can be re-compiled from source code, offer pre-compiled binaries for the most popular platforms and operating systems.\n\nBlock\nThe abstract term used to describe units of markup that, composed together, form the content or layout of a webpage. The idea combines concepts of what in WordPress today we achieve with shortcodes, custom HTML, and embed discovery into a single consistent API and user experience.\nBlock ~Inserter~ Library\nPrimary interface for selecting from the available blocks, triggered by plus icon buttons on Blocks or in the top-left of the editor interface.\nBlock categories\nThese are not a WordPress taxonomy, but instead used internally to sort blocks in the Block Library.\nBlock name\nA unique identifier for a block type, consisting of a plugin-specific namespace and a short label describing the block’s intent. e.g. core/image\nBlock styles\nThe CSS styles that are part of the block, either via its stylesheet or via the block markup itself. For example, a class attached to the block markup is considered block styles. \nCompare to Global Styles. In contraposition to Global Styles, block styles are sometimes referred to as Local Styles.\nLearn more about Block Styles.\nBlock supports\nAn API for blocks to declare what features they support. By declaring support for a feature, the API would add additional attributes to the block and matching UI controls for most of the existing block supports. \nSee Block Supports reference documentation for a deep dive into the API.\nBlock Template parts\nBuilding on Block Templates, these parts help set structure for reusable items like a Footer or Header that one typically sees in a WordPress site. They are primarily site structure and are never to be mixed with the post content editor. With Full Site Editing and block based themes, users can create their own arbitrary Template Parts, save those in the database for their site, and re-use them throughout their site. Template parts are equivalent – in blocks – of theme template parts. They are generally defined by a theme first, carry some semantic meaning (could be swapped between themes such as a header), and can only be inserted in the site editor context (within “templates”).\nBlock Templates\nA template is a predefined arrangement of blocks, possibly with predefined attributes or placeholder content. You can provide a template for a post type, to give users a starting point when creating a new piece of content, or inside a custom block with the InnerBlocks component. At their core, templates are simply HTML files of block markup that map to templates from the standard WordPress template hierarchy, for example index, single or archive. This helps control the front-end defaults of a site that are not edited via the Page Editor or the Post Editor. See the templates documentation for more information.\nBlock Themes\nA theme built in block forward way that allows Full Site Editing to work. The core of a block theme are its block templates and block template parts. To date, block theme templates have been HTML files of block markup that map to templates from the standard WordPress template hierarchy.\nBlock type\nIn contrast with the blocks composing a particular post, a block type describes the blueprint by which any block of that type should behave. So while there may be many images within a post, each behaves consistent with a unified image block type definition.\nBlog\nA blog, or weblog, is an online journal, diary, or serial published by a person or group of people.\n\nBlogs are commonly used by individuals, peer groups, companies, or organizations.\nBlogs often contain public as well as private content. Depending on the functionality of the CMS  software that is used, some authors may restrict access — through the  use of accounts or passwords — to content that is too personal to be  published publicly. \nBlogging\nBlogging is the act of writing in one’s blog. To blog something is to write about something in one’s blog. This sometimes involves linking to something the author finds interesting on the internet.\n\n See also: Blogosphere, Blogroll\nBlogosphere\nThe blogosphere is the subset of internet web sites which are, or relate to, blogs. \n See also: Blog, Blogroll\nBlogroll\nA blogroll is a list of links to various blogs or news sites. Often a blogroll is “rolled” by a service which tracks updates (using feeds)  to each site in the list, and provides the list in a form which  aggregates update information. The default blogroll (aka links) included  in WordPress was removed in version 3.5. \n See also: Blog, Blogosphere, Feed, News reader External links: News aggregator at Wikipedia\nBookmarklet\nA bookmarklet (or favelet) is a “faux” bookmark containing scripting code, usually written in JavaScript, that allows the user to perform a function. \nExamples:\n\n The delicious.com bookmarklets allow users to quickly post a link to their delicious.com bookmarks list. Tantek’s favelets\nBoolean\nA variable or expression which evaluates to either true or false.\n\n External links: PHP Boolean data type\nCategory\nEach post in WordPress can be filed under one or more categories.  Thoughtful categorization allows posts to be grouped with others of similar content and aids in the navigation of a site.\n\nPlease note that a post category should not be confused with a link category, which is used to classify and manage links.\n\nCapabilities\nA capability is permission to perform one or more types of\ntask. Each user of a WordPress site might have some permissions but not\nothers, depending on their role.\n For example, users who have the Author role usually have permission to\nedit their own posts (the “edit_posts” capability), but not permission\nto edit other users’ posts (the “edit_others_posts” capability).\nWordPress comes with six roles and over fifty capabilities in its\nrole-based access system. Plugins can modify the system.\n\n Related article: Roles and Capabilities External link: Role-based access control (Wikipedia)\nCGI\nCGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a specification for server-side communication scripts designed to transfer information between a web server and a web-client (browser).  Typically, HTML pages that collect data via forms use CGI programming to process the form data once the client submits it.\n\nCharacter Entity\nA character entity is a method used to display special characters normally reserved for use in HTML.  For example, the less than (<) and greater than (>) are used as part the HTML tag structure, so both symbols are reserved for that use.  But, if you need to display those symbols on your site, you can use character entities.  For example:\n\nuse &lt;  for the less than (<) symbol\nuse &gt;  for the greater than (>) symbol\n\n Related articles: Fun Character Entities\nCharacter Set\nA character set is a collection of symbols (letters, numbers,\npunctuation, and special characters), when used together, represent\nmeaningful words in a language.  Computers use an encoding scheme so\nmembers of a character set are stored with a numeric value (e.g. 0=A,\n1=B, 2=C, 3=D).  In addition, a collation determines the order (i.e alphabetic) to use when sorting the character set.\n\nBy default, WordPress uses the Unicode UTF-8 (utf8) character set for the WordPress MySQL database tables created during the installation process.  Beginning with Version 2.2, the database character set (and collation) is defined in the wp-config.php file.\n\n See also: Collation Related articles: Editing wp-config.php, Converting Database Character Sets External links: Character set at Wikipedia, Unicode at Wikipedia, UTF-8 at Wikipedia, Character sets and collation at MySQL\nchmod\nchmod is a Unix/Linux shell command used to change permissions on files. Its name is a contraction of “change mode.”\n\n Related articles: Changing File Permissions, UNIX Shell Skills, htaccess for subdirectories\nClass\nClasses are groupings of CSS styles which can be applied to any HTML element.\nFor classes in PHP, see the Class (Computing) article at Wikipedia and PHP Manual: Classes and Objects.\n\n Related articles: CSS, Blog Design and Layout\nClassic block\nA block which embeds the TinyMCE editor as a block, TinyMCE was the base of the previous core editor. Older content created prior to the block editor will be loaded in to a single Classic block.\nCodex\nThe Codex is the series of articles that show users how to use\n WordPress. WordPress users contribute documentation to the codex\nvoluntarily.\n\nExternal links: Codex\nCollation\nCollation refers to the order used to sort the letters, numbers, and symbols of a given character set.  For example, because WordPress, by default, uses the UTF-8 (utf8) character set, and when the WordPress MySQL database tables are created during the installation process, MySQL assigns utf8_general_ci collation to those tables.  Beginning with Version 2.2, the collation (and character set) used by WordPress is defined in the wp-config.php file.\n\n See also: Character set Related articles: Editing wp-config.php, Converting Database Character Sets External links: Collation at Wikipedia, Character set at Wikipedia, UTF-8 at Wikipedia, Character sets and collation at MySQL\nComments\nComments are a feature of blogs which allow readers to respond to posts. Typically readers simply provide their own thoughts regarding the content of the post, but users may also provide links to other resources, generate discussion, or simply compliment the author for a well-written post.\n\nYou can control and regulate comments by filters for language and\n content. Comments can be queued for approval before they are visible on\n the web site. This is useful in dealing with comment spam.\n\n See also: Blog Related articles: Comment-related plugins, Dealing with comment spam, Settings Discussion SubPanel External links: Hyperlink at Wikipedia\nContent\nContent consists of text, images, or other information shared in posts.\n This is separate from the structural design of a web site, which\nprovides a framework into which the content is inserted, and the\npresentation of a site, which involves graphic design. A Content Management System changes and updates content, rather than the structural or graphic design of a web site.\n\nContent Management System\nA Content Management System, or CMS, is software for facilitating the maintenance of content, but not design, on a web site. A blogging tool is an example of a Content Management System.\n\n See also: Blog\ncPanel\ncPanel is a popular web-based administration tool that many hosting providers provide to allow users to configure their own accounts using an easy-to-use interface.\n\n Related articles: Using cPanel, Adding New Themes by using cPanel External links: cPanel website\nCSS\nCSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a W3C open standards\n programming language for specifying how a web page is presented. It\nallows web site designers to create formatting and layout for a web site\n independently of its content.\n\n Related articles: CSS, Blog Design and Layout External links: CSS at W3C, Open standards at Wikipedia, W3C.org\nCVS\nCVS stands for Concurrent Versions System and is the software that used to be used to coordinate WordPress development. As of  February 2005, this function is carried out by Subversion (SVN). \nFor more information on Subversion, see Using Subversion.\n\nDashboard\nIn WordPress a Dashboard is the main administration screen for\n a site (a weblog), or for a network of sites. It summarizes information\n about the site or network, and also external information, in one or\nmore widgets that the Dashboard user can enable, disable, and move around.\n\n Related articles: Dashboard Screen\nDatabase\nA database in computing terms is software used to manage information in an organized fashion. WordPress uses the MySQL or MariaDB relational databases management system for storing and retrieving the content of your blog, such as posts, comments, and so on.\n\n Related articles: Database Description, Backing Up Your Database\nDatabase version\nIn WordPress, the database version is a number that increases every time changes are made to the way WordPress organizes the data in its database. It is not the same as the version of the database software, MySQL or MariaDB.\n\nFor example, the database version in WordPress 3.3 was 19470, and\n the database version in WordPress 3.3.1 did not change. This tells\nanyone planning to use backed-up data from the older version that they\ndo not need to check for changes in the structure of the data.\n\nWordPress stores its database version in the database, as the\noption named “db_version” in every WordPress site’s “wp_options” table.\n(The table name prefix “wp_” may be missing or different in some cases.)\n\n Related articles: Database Description, How do you force a database upgrade?\nDefault theme\nEvery installation of WordPress has a default theme.  The default theme is sometimes called the fallback theme, because if the active theme is for some reason lost or deleted, WordPress will fallback to using the default theme. \nDeprecated\nDeprecated functions or template tags are no longer supported, and will soon be obsolete.\n\n Related articles: “Deprecated Functions” Category\nDeveloper\nA developer, or dev, is a computer programmer who is active in creating, modifying, and updating a software product.\n\n Related articles: Plugin API\nDIV\nA DIV element in HTML marks a section of text. DIVs are used extensively in WordPress to apply CSS stylings to particular blog elements.\n\n Related articles: CSS, Blog Design and Layout\nDNS\nDNS, the domain name system, is the system that maps domain names to IP addresses.\n When you use a web browser to visit a website, your browser first\nextracts the site’s domain name from the URL. Then it uses the DNS to\nfind the IP address for that domain name. Then it connects to that IP\naddress.\n\n External link: Domain Name System (Wikipedia)\nDOM\nDOM (Document Object Model) is a standard,\nplatform-independent interface that allows programmers to dynamically\naccess HTML and XML to control the content and structure of documents.\nDOM connects programming scripts to web pages.\n\n External links: DOM at Wikipedia, DOM at W3C.org\nDomain name\nA domain name is a name used for identification purposes on\nthe Internet. In WordPress a domain name usually identifies a server\nwhere WordPress is installed. To make this work, the Internet’s domain\nname system (DNS) maps the domain name to a server’s IP address. For example, the domain name example.com maps to the IP address 192.0.43.10.\n Many domain names can map to the same IP address, allowing a single\nserver to run many websites. For example, the domain names www.example.com and example.net also map to the IP address 192.0.43.10.\n\n External link: Domain name (Wikipedia)\nDraft\nThe draft post status is for WordPress posts which are saved, but as yet unpublished. A draft post can only be edited through the Administration Panel, Write Post SubPanel by users of equal or greater User Level than the post’s author.\n\nDynamic block\nA type of block where the content of which may change and cannot be determined at the time of saving a post, instead calculated any time the post is shown on the front of a site. These blocks may save fallback content or no content at all in their JavaScript implementation, instead deferring to a PHP block implementation for runtime rendering.\nExcerpt\nAn excerpt is a condensed description of your blog post and refers to the summary entered in the Excerpt field of the Administration > Posts > Add New SubPanel.  The excerpt is used to describe your post in RSS feeds and is typically used in displaying search results. The excerpt is sometimes used in displaying the Archives and Category views of your posts.  Use the Template Tag the_excerpt()\n to display the contents of this field.  Note that if you do not enter\ninformation into the Excerpt field when writing a post, and you use the_excerpt() in your theme template files, WordPress will automatically display the first 55 words of the post‘s content.\n\nAn excerpt should not be confused with the teaser, which refers to words before the \n<!--more-->\n in a post’s content. When typing a long post you can insert the \n<!--more-->\n Quicktag after a few sentences to act as a cut-off point.  When the post is displayed, the teaser, followed by a hyperlink (such as Read the rest of this entry…), is displayed.  Your visitor can then click on that link to see the full version of your post. The Template Tag, the_content() should be used to display the teaser.\n\n Related articles: Customizing the Read More, Excerpt\nBack to the Top\nFeed\nA feed is a function of special software that allows\n“Feedreaders” to access a site automatically looking for new content and\n then posting the information about new content and updates to another\nsite. This provides a way for users to keep up with the latest and\nhottest information posted on different blogging sites.  Some Feeds\ninclude RSS (alternately defined as “Rich Site Summary” or “Really\nSimple Syndication”), Atom or RDF files.  Dave Shea, author of the web\ndesign weblog Mezzoblue has written a comprehensive summary of feeds.  Feeds generally are based on XML technology.\n\nFeed Reader\nThe role of Feedreader is to gather and display the webfeed from various website to one place.\n\nFilter\nIn WordPress, a Filter is a function that is associated with an existing Action by specifying any existing Hook.\n\nDevelopers can create custom Filters using the Filter API to replace code from an existing Action. This process is called “hooking“.\n\nCustom Filters differ from custom Actions because custom Actions allow you to add or remove code from existing Actions. Whereas custom Filters allow you to replace specific data (such as a variable) found within an existing Action.\n\n See also: Action, Hook, Terminology Confusion  Related articles: Filters, Filter Reference, add_filter()\nFooter area\nA footer area is a horizontal area provided by a theme for displaying information other than the main content of the web page. Themes may provide one or more footer areas below the content. Footer areas usually contain widgets that an administrator of the site can customize.\n\nIn a theme, footer areas are generated by a template file, typically named sidebar-footer.php.\n\n See also: Sidebar Related articles: Templates, Customizing Your Sidebar, Stepping Into Templates, Template Hierarchy\nFront End\nThe front end is what your visitors see and interact with when they come to your website, www.YourSite.com.\n\nFTP\nFTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a client-server\nprotocol for transferring files. It is one way to download files, and\nthe most common way to upload files to a server.\n\nAn FTP client is a program which can download files from, or upload files to, an FTP server.\n\nYou may need to use an FTP client to upload your WordPress files to your web server, particularly if you use a hosting provider.\n\n Related articles: FTP Clients, Uploading WordPress to a remote host, Using FileZilla\nFull Site Editing or FSE\nThis refers to a collection of features that ultimately allows users to edit their entire website using blocks as the starting point. This feature set includes everything from block patterns to global styles to templates to design tools for blocks (and more). First released in WordPress 5.9.\nGallery\nAs defined by Andy Skelton, Gallery, introduced with WordPress 2.5,\n is specifically an exposition of images attached to a post.  In that\nsame vein, an upload is “attached to a post” when you upload it while\nediting a post.\n\nIn the uploader there is a “Gallery” tab that shows all the\nuploads attached to the post you are editing. When you have more than\none attachment in a post, you should see at the bottom of the Gallery\ntab a button marked “Insert gallery”. That button inserts a shortcode\n“” into the post. WordPress replaces that shortcode with an\nexposition of all images attached to that post. Non-image file types are\n excluded from the gallery.\n\nNote: If you don’t see the “Insert gallery” button, it may be because you have not attached two images to the post.\n\nThe pretty URLs for attachments are made only after you have published the post and should be composed as the post permalink plus the attachment slug.\n\n Related articles: Gallery Shortcode, Shortcode API\ngettext\nThe gettext system is a set of tools and standards for\nlanguage translation, used by WordPress to provide versions in many\nlanguages. In WordPress a text string for translation may have a domain\nand a context. For example, a plugin might specify its own domain for\ntranslations, and a context might help translators to provide different\ntranslations of the same English word or phrase in different parts of\nthe user interface.\n\n Related articles: WordPress in Your Language, Translating WordPress, I18n for WordPress Developers External links: gettext (Wikipedia), GNU gettext\nGMT\nGMT (“Greenwich Mean Time”, the time at the Royal Observatory\nin Greenwich, England) is the old name of the time zone from which all\nother time zones were measured. It has been replaced by UTC\n (“Universal Time, Coordinated”), but for most practical purposes UTC\nand GMT are the same, so the term GMT is still commonly used.\n\n External links: Greenwich Mean Time, Time zone, UTC (Wikipedia)\nGravatar\nA gravatar is a globally recognized avatar\n (a graphic image or picture that represents a user). Typically a user’s\n gravatar is associated with their email address, and using a service\nsuch as Gravatar.com. The site owner to can configure their site so that a user’s gravatar is displayed along with their comments.\n\n See also: Avatar Related articles: How to Use Gravatars in WordPress, Using Gravatars External links: Gravatar at Wikipedia\nGUI\nGUI stands for Graphical User Interface, pronounced as “gooey”. It is\n an interface that allows users to point the mouse or cursor to\ngraphical icons.\n\nGutenberg\nGutenberg is newly developed, block-oriented editor. It uses blocks\nto create all types of content, replacing a half-dozen inconsistent ways\n of customizing WordPress, bringing it in line with modern coding\nstandards, and aligning with open web initiatives. These content blocks\ntransform how users, developers, and hosts interact with WordPress to\nmake building rich web content easier and more intuitive, democratizing\npublishing — and work — for everyone, regardless of technical ability.\n\nHack\nA hack is a bit of code written to customize or extend the\nfunctionality of a software product. Older versions of WordPress used a\nhack-based extension system, but versions 1.2 and above of WordPress use a Plugin API with hooks for extensions.\n\n See also: Hacking, Plugin Related articles: Changelog, Plugin API External links: Open source at Wikipedia\nHacking\nHacking is the process of writing code for, or contributing code to, a piece of software.\n\nThere is some controversy surrounding the meaning of this term.\nIt began as a benign term meaning “to exercise proficiency” or “to alter\n or improve,” but the popular media have since construed it to mean “to\nbreak into a computer system, usually with malicious intent.” Many in\nthe computer industry have recently begun trying to ‘take back’ the word\n from its popular mutation, and many have adopted the term cracking\n to replace the malicious interpretation. Because of the desire to\nreclaim the word, you will often find the term used in conjunction with open source projects, intended in its benign form. For more information about the history of the term, please see Wikipedia’s article on Hacker.\n\n See also: Hack Related articles: Plugins\nHeader Image\nA Header Image is a wide picture that appears at the top of a WordPress website.\n\nHook\nHooks are specified, by the developer, in Actions and Filters. Here is a (hopefully) complete list of all existing Hooks within WordPress.\n\nBecause Hooks are required by Actions and Filter you may hear the\n phrase “Action Hooks” and “Filter Hooks” used from time to time.\n\nIn technical and strict terms: a Hook is an event, i.e. event as understood by Observer pattern, invoked by the do_action() or apply_filters() call that afterwards triggers all the action or filter functions, previously hooked to that event using add_action() or add_filter(), respectively.\n\n See also: Action, Filter Related articles: Hooks, Actions and Filters, Plugin API/Hooks\nTerminology Confusion\nWordPress Codex and source code comments sometimes confuse the terms “actions/filters” and “hooks“.\n\nActions, Filters and Hooks are also occasionally referred to as “action/filter hooks” or “action/filter/hook functions”.\n\nHosting provider\nA hosting provider is a company or organization which  provides, usually for a fee, infrastructure for making information  accessible via the web. This involves the use of a web server (including web server software such as Apache), and may involve one or more related technologies, such as FTP, PHP, MySQL or MariaDB, and operating system software such as Linux or Unix. \n Related articles: Hosting WordPress\n.htaccess\nA .htaccess file is a granular configuration file for the Apache web server\n software, used to set or alter the server’s configuration settings for\nthe directory in which it is present, and/or its child directories.\n\nWordPress uses an .htaccess file in conjunction with the mod_rewrite Apache module to produce permalinks.\n\nNote that .htaccess is a hidden file in Unix/Linux (as dictated by the preceding period ‘.’), meaning it may not be visible using the default settings of some FTP clients.\n\n See also: chmod Related articles: htaccess for subdirectories, Using Permalinks, UNIX Shell Skills, Changing File Permissions\nHTML\nHTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language used to describe the semantic content of web pages. It is usually used with CSS and/or JavaScript. WordPress renders web pages to conform to the HTML5 standard. The standard is set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).\n\nIDE\nAcronym for Integrated Development Environment. Is an application that provides several tools for software development.\nAn IDE usually includes:\n\n source code editor, which is similar to a Text Editor debugger, in the case of WordPress, useful debuggers are those for PHP and Javascript code automated builder\nFor our recommended IDEs, please see Editing Files.\nInspector\nDeprecated term. See Settings Sidebar.\nIP address\nAn IP address is a unique number (e.g. 70.84.29.148)\nassigned to a computer (or other internet-capable information appliance,\n such as a network printer) to enable it to communicate with other\ndevices using the Internet Protocol. It is a computer’s identity\non the internet, and every computer connected to the internet is\nassigned at least one — although the methods of assigning these\naddresses, and the permanence and duration of their assignment, differ\naccording to the use of the computer and the circumstances of its\ninternet use.\n\nEvery web server is assigned an IP address as well, but often times hosting providers\n will assign multiple IP addresses to one computer, in the event that\nmultiple web sites reside on the same physical server. This is the case\nwith most inexpensive ‘managed’ or ‘group’ hosting packages.\n\nDomain names\n were created to provide an easier means of accessing internet resources\n than IP addresses, which are cumbersome to type and difficult to\nremember. Every domain name has at least one corresponding IP address,\nbut only a small number of IP addresses have a domain name associated\nwith them, since only computers that are servers require domain names.\nThe domain name system (DNS) is what maps domain names to IP addresses.\n\n External links: IP address (Wikipedia)\nISAPI\nISAPI (Internet Server Application Programming Interface) is a\n set of programming standards designed to allow programmers to quickly\nand easily develop efficient Web-based applications.  Developed by\nProcess Software and Microsoft Corporation, ISAPI is intended to replace CGI programs.\n\n External links: ISAPI at Wikipedia\nJavaScript\nJavaScript is a programming language that WordPress uses to\nmake certain processing occur in your web browser when it is\ninconvenient or impossible for the server to do that processing. For\nexample, when you reply to a comment in a WordPress blog, WordPress uses\n JavaScript to move the comment form inside the comment you are replying\n to.\n\n See also: AJAX, HTML, XHTML Related article: Using Javascript External link: JavaScript (Wikipedia)\nLinux\nLinux is an open source computer operating system, created by Linus Torvalds, similar in style to Unix.

The\n operating system was commercially released in 2001. It consists of two\nmain parts: Darwin, an open source Unix-like\n environment which is based on the BSD source tree and the Mach\nmicrokernel, adapted and further developed by Apple Computer with\ninvolvement from independent developers; and a proprietary GUI named\nAqua, developed by Apple.\n\n Related articles: UNIX Shell Skills\nMariaDB\nMariaDB is a fork of the MySQL relational database system developed by most of the original developers of MySQL. It works equally well with WordPress.\n\nMenu\nMenus are lists of links to pages and posts that appear on WordPress websites.\n\nMeta\nMeta has several meanings, but generally means information about.  In WordPress, meta usually refers to administrative type information.  As described in Meta Tags in WordPress, meta is the HTML tag used to describe and define a web page to the outside world (search engines).  In the article Post Meta Data, meta refers to information associated with each post, such as the author’s name and the date posted.  Meta Rules define the general protocol to follow in using the Codex.  Also, many WordPress based sites offer a Meta section, usually found in the sidebar, with links to login or register at that site.  Finally, Meta is a MediaWiki namespace that refers to administrative functions within Codex.\n\n External links: Wikipedia’s Article on Meta\nMicroformats\nMicroformats provide a way for programs to read certain\ninformation in web pages without making the pages look any different to\nhumans. They add semantics to the generic HTML markup in order for these\n programs to understand the meaning of specific parts of a web page\ncontent which is better recognized by humans. For example, a web page\ndisplaying a user’s profile could use microformats to make it easy for a\n program to extract the user’s contact information so that it can be\nadded to an address book in a single operation. In WordPress, some themes and plugins support some microformats.\n\n Related: Themes and plugins providing microformats support External links: Microformats.org\nMIME\nMIME stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension and is an Internet standard that extends the format of email to support:\n\n Text in character sets other than ASCII Non-text attachments Message bodies with multiple parts Header information in non-ASCII character sets\nMIME’s use, however, has grown beyond describing the content of email\n and now is often used to describe content type in general including for\n the web and as a storage for rich content in some commercial products.\n\n External links: IANA Media Types Specification, Wikipedia\nMoblogging\nMoblogging is the act of posting to one’s blog via a mobile device (e.g. mobile phone, smartphone, or tablet). It is pronounced as mōbə-logging or mōb-logging, or sometimes as mŏb-logging in reference to smart mobs. \n Related articles: Moblog Clients, Post to your blog using email\nmod_rewrite\nmod_rewrite is an extension module of the Apache web server software which allows for “rewriting” of URLs on-the-fly. Rewrite rules use regular expressions\n to parse the requested URL from the client, translate it into a\ndifferent URL, and serve the content of this new URL under the original\nURL or pointing the client to make the new URL request.\n\nWordPress uses mod_rewrite for its permalink structure, and also for multisite networks, which are both optional functionality.\n\n Related articles: Using Permalinks, Create A Network\nMultisite\nMultisite is a feature of WordPress 3.0 and later versions that allows multiple virtual sites\n to share a single WordPress installation. When the multisite feature is\n activated, the original WordPress site can be converted to support a network of sites.\n\n Related article: Create A Network\nMySQL\nMySQL is a popular open source SQL (Structured Query Language) database implementation, available for many platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X.\n\nWordPress requires a MySQL database to store all blog information, including posts, comments, metadata, and other information.\n\nWordPress also works with MySQL-compatible databases such as MariaDB and Percona Server.\n\n Related articles: Database Description External links: MySQL, MariaDB, Percona Server\nBack to the Top\nNavigation\nNavigation is the term used to describe text on a page that, when\nselected, redirects you to a corresponding page elsewhere on the\nwebsite. Navigation may sometimes be referred to as the menu, links and\nhyperlinks.\n\nNavigation Block\nA block that allows you to edit a site’s navigation menu, both in terms of structure and design.\nNetwork\nIn the WordPress user interface, a network is a collection of separate sites created in a single WordPress installation by the multisite\n feature. The sites in a WordPress network are not interconnected like\nthe things in other kinds of networks. They are very like the separate\nblogs at WordPress.com.\n\nIn WordPress code the network is known as the site and the sites are known as blogs.\n\n Related articles: Create A Network\nNews reader\nA news aggregator or news (feed) reader is a computer program which tracks syndicated information feeds, via RSS, RDF, or Atom.\n Most news aggregators allow one to ‘subscribe’ to a feed, and\nautomatically keep track of the articles one has read, similar to an\nemail client tracking read emails.\n\nMany blogs make their content available in feed form for the convenience of readers using news aggregators. WordPress can generate feeds in RSS and/or Atom formats.\n\n External links: News aggregator at Wikipedia\nNonce\nNonce is used for security purposes to protect against\nunexpected or duplicate requests that could cause undesired permanent or\n irreversible changes to the web site and particularly to its database.\nSpecifically, a nonce is an one-time token generated by a web site\n to identify future requests to that web site. When a request is\nsubmitted, the web site verifies if a previously generated nonce\nexpected for this particular kind of request was sent along and decides\nwhether the request can be safely processed, or a notice of failure\nshould be returned. This could prevent unwanted repeated, expired or\nmalicious requests from being processed.\n\nNonce is usually included in a hidden HTML form field or as a\npart of an URL and therefore sent with a request by submitting a form\nfield or visiting a link. If a request is not verified, the web site\ncould generate a new nonce in its response and prompt the user to\nintentionally  confirm the repetition of the request. In WordPress, the\nresponse message is “Are you sure you want to do this?” by default.\n\n Related articles: WordPress Nonces\nOpen Source\nOpen source is simply programming code that can be read,\nviewed, modified, and distributed, by anyone who desires.  WordPress is\ndistributed under an open source GNU General Public License (GPL).\n\n Related articles: GPL, License  External links: Open Source Initiative, Open Source at Wikipedia, Source Code at Wikipedia\nOptions\nOptions are pieces of data that WordPress uses to store various preferences and configuration settings.\nBy using the Options API that is a simple and standardized way of storing data in the database, options can be added, changed, removed, and retrieved, from the wp_options table.\n\n Related articles: Option Reference, Transients API, Options API\nOutput Compression\nOutput Compression is the removal of white spaces, carriage\nreturns, new lines and tabs from your HTML document. This reduces the\nfile size of the HTML document without changing the functionality.\n\n Related articles: Output Compression \nPage (post type)\nA Page is often used to present “static” information about\nyourself or your site.  A good example of a Page is information you\nwould place on an About Page.  A Page should not be confused with the\ntime-oriented objects called posts.   Pages are typically “timeless” in nature and live “outside” your blog.\n\nThe word “page” has long been used to describe any HTML document\non the web. In WordPress, however, “Page” refers to a very specific\nfeature first introduced in WordPress version 1.5.\n\n Related articles: Pages, Write Page SubPanel\nPatterns\nPatterns are predefined layouts of blocks that can be inserted as starter content that are meant to be changed by the user every time. Once inserted, they exist as a local save and are not global.\nPerl\nPerl is an acronym for Practical Extraction and Report Language,\n but it’s most commonly spelled as a proper name. It’s a very popular\nand powerful scripting language used for web applications, although its\nuse is being largely replaced by PHP in the mainstream. One of its strengths lies in its speedy and effective use of regular expressions. Its unofficial motto is, “There’s More Than One Way To Do It,” or “TMTOWTDI,” owing to the extreme flexibility of the syntax.\n\nWordPress does not use Perl, and it is therefore not required.\n\nPermalink\nA permalink is a URL at which a resource or article will be permanently stored. Many pages driven by Content Management Systems\n contain excerpts of content which is frequently rotated, making linking\n to bits of information within them a game of chance. Permalinks allow\nusers to bookmark full articles at a URL they know will never change, and will always present the same content.\n\nPermalinks are optional in WordPress, but are highly recommended as they greatly increase the cleanliness of URL. WordPress uses the Apache module mod_rewrite to implement its permalink system.\n\n Related articles: Using Permalinks External links: URL at Wikipedia\nPermissions\nPermissions are security settings restricting or allowing users to perform certain functions. In the case of files on Unix or Linux systems, there are three types of permissions: read, write, and execute. In the case of MySQL or MariaDB databases, there are many more: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc. — although MySQL/MariaDB refer to them as privileges.\n\n Related articles: Changing File Permissions\nPHP\nPHP is a recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. It is a popular server-side scripting language designed specifically for integration with HTML, and is used (often in conjunction with MySQL or MariaDB) in Content Management Systems and other web applications. It is available on many platforms, including Windows, Unix/Linux and Mac OS X, and is open source software.\n\nWordPress is written using PHP and requires it for operation.\n\n External links: PHP Website, PHP for Designers — by WordPress lead developer Matthew Mullenweg, PHP at OnLAMP\nphpMyAdmin\nphpMyAdmin is a popular, powerful web-based interface for administering MySQL or MariaDB databases. It is open source, written in PHP, and is among the better tools available for working with MySQL or MariaDB databases.\n\n Related articles: phpMyAdmin External links: phpMyAdmin web site\nPing\nWithin the WordPress interface, “ping” is sometimes used to refer to Pingbacks and Trackbacks.\n\nIn general computer terms, “ping” is a common utility used in a TCP/IP environment to determine if a given IP Address\n exists or is reachable.  Typically, Ping is used to diagnose a network\nconnection problem.  Many times you will be asked, “Can you ping that\naddress?”.   That means, does the Ping utility return a success message\ntrying to reach the “problem” IP Address?\n\n External links: Ping at Wikipedia\nPingback\nPingback lets you notify the author of an article if you link\nto his article (article on a blog, of course). If the links you include\nin an article you write on a blog lead to a blog which is\npingback-enabled, then the author of that blog gets a notification in\nthe form of a pingback that you linked to his article.\n\nIf you’re feeling really geeky you may want to check out the Pingback technical specification or  Otto’s “How Pingbacks Work” explanation.\n\n See also: Trackback Related articles: Introduction to Blogging: Pingbacks\nPlugin\nA Plugin is a group of PHP functions that can extend the\nfunctionality present in a standard WordPress weblog. These functions\nmay all be defined in one php file, or may be spread among more than one\n file. Usually, a plugin is a PHP file that can be uploaded to the\n“wp-content/plugins” directory on your webserver, where you have\ninstalled WordPress. Once you have uploaded the plugin file, you should\nbe able to “turn it on” or Enable it from the “Plugins” page in the\nadministration interface of your weblog. The WordPress source code\ncontains hooks that can be used by plugins.\n\n See also: Hack, Hacking Related articles: Plugins\nPort\nWithin the context of the WordPress community, a port is a bit\n of code that has been rewritten to be compatible with WordPress.  For\nexample, if someone wrote a plugin for MoveableType, WordPress users may\n want to find a port of that plugin for WordPress.  Port can also be\nused as a verb: to rewrite a piece of software for a different\nplatform/language.\n\n External links: Porting at Wikipedia\nPost\nAlso known as “articles” and sometimes incorrectly referred to as\n“blogs”. In WordPress, “posts” are articles that you write to populate\nyour blog.\n\nPost settings\nA sidebar region containing metadata fields for the post, including scheduling, visibility, terms, and featured image.\nPost Slug\nA few lowercase words separated by dashes, describing a post and\nusually derived from the post title to create a user-friendly (that is,\nreadable and without confusing characters) permalink. Post slug substitutes the “%posttitle%” placeholder in a custom permalink structure. Post slug should not be changed and is especially useful if the post title tends to be long or changes frequently.\n\nPost Status\nThe status of a post, as set in the Administration Panel, Write Post SubPanel is either: Published (viewable by everyone), Draft (incomplete post viewable by anyone with proper user level), or Private (viewable only to WordPress users at Administrator level).\n\n Related articles: Post Status\nPost Type\nPost type refers to the various structured data that is maintained in\n the WordPress posts table.  Native (or built-in) registered post types\nare post, page, attachment, revision, and nav-menu-item.  Custom post types are also supported in WordPress and can be defined with register_post_type().\n  Custom post types allow users to easily create and manage such things\nas portfolios, projects, video libraries, podcasts, quotes, chats, and\nwhatever a user or developer can imagine.\n\n Related articles: Post Types\nQuery\nThe process behind the scenes. See below. 🙂\n\n Related articles: Query Overview, Custom Queries, WP Query, WP User Query See also: query string, query variable\nQuery Block\nA block that replicates the classic WP_Query and allows for further customization with additional functionality.\nQuery String\nA sequence of codes in a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that a web page uses to determine what dynamic data to display. The query string in a URI\n comes after an initial question mark, and may contain several\nparameters separated by ampersands.  WordPress uses query strings to\nindicate criteria to search for specific posts or sets of posts in the\ndatabase. The use of query strings is generally believed to impede the\nindexing of dynamic pages by search engines. For this reason, it is\noften desirable to use a method such as mod_rewrite to reduce exposure of query strings to search engines and other site visitors.\n\nQuery Variable\nA variable passed through the query string. For example, in the query string ?category_name=tech&feed=atom, there are two query variables: category_name with a value of “tech”, and feed with a value of “atom”.\n\nQuickTag\nA Quicktag is a shortcut, or one-click button, that inserts\nHTML code into your posts.  The <em> (emphasis) and </em>\n(stop emphasis) HTML tags are example of Quicktags.  Some Quicktags,\nsuch as <!–contactform–>, insert HTML comment code that is used\nby plugins to replace text or perform certain actions.\n\nBack to the Top\nRDF\nResource Description Framework. A language used to describe the  locations of resources on the web. WordPress can produce output in RDF  format that describes the locations of posts. Like RSS, RDF is used for  content syndication. \nRecordset\nRecordset refers to the group of records or result returned from a database query.\n\n See also MySQL, wpdb database class\nRelative Path\nA relative path is the location of a file in relation to the\ncurrent working directory and does not begin with a slash (/).  This is\ndifferent from an absolute path which gives an exact location.\n\n See also: Absolute Path  External links: Path_Computing at Wikipedia\nRelative URI\nA relative URI (sometimes called a relative link) is a partial URI that is interpreted (resolved) relative to a base URI.\n\nOn the World Wide Web, relative URIs come in two forms:\n\nA relative URI with an absolute path is interpreted relative to the domain root:\n\n /images/icecream.jpg →︎ http://domain.example/images/icecream.jpg\n\nA relative URI with a relative path is interpreted relative to the URL of the current document. E.g., on the web page http://domain.example/icecream/chocolate.html,\n\n strawberry.html →︎ http://domain.example/icecream/strawberry.html\n\nWikipedia: URI Resolution\n\nReusable Block\nA block that is saved and then can be shared as a reusable, repeatable piece of content.\nRichText\nA common component enabling rich content editing including bold, italics, hyperlinks, etc.\nRSS\n“Really Simple Syndication“: a format for syndicating many\ntypes of content, including blog entries, torrent files, video clips on\nnews-like sites; specifically frequently updated content on a Web site,\nand is also known as a type of “feed” or “aggregator”.  An RSS feed can\ncontain a summary of content or the full text, and makes it easier for\npeople to keep up to date with sites they like in an automated manner\n(much like e-mail).\n\nThe content of the feed can be read by using software called an RSS or Feed reader.\n\nFeed readers display hyperlinks, and include other metadata (information\n about information) that helps people decide whether they want to read\nmore, follow a link, or move on.\n\nThe original intent of RSS is to make information come to you\n(via the feed reader) instead of you going out to look for it (via the\nWeb).\n\nPrograms called news aggregators permit users to view many feeds at once, providing ‘push’ content constantly. See Category:Feeds for Codex resources about bringing RSS feeds into WordPress. See also RDF Site Summary.\n\nRTL\nA written language is Right-to-left when its script flows from the right side of the page to the left.\n\n Related articles: Right-to-Left Language Support\nRobots.txt\nWeb Robots are programs which traverse the Web automatically. They\nare also called Web Wanderers, Web Crawlers, and Spiders. Search Engines\n are the main Web Robots.  Some Web Robots look for a file named robots.txt on your web server to see what and where they should look for content and files on your web server. Some Web Robots ignore this file.\n\n Related articles: Search Engine Optimization for WordPress External links: Google information about robots.txt, The Web Robots Page\nRole\nA role gives users permission to perform a group of tasks. When a user logs in and is authenticated, the user’s role determines which capabilities\n the user has, and each capability is permission to perform one or more\ntypes of task. All users with the same role normally have the same\ncapabilities. For example, users who have the Author role usually have\npermission to edit their own posts, but not permission to edit other\nusers’ posts. WordPress comes with six roles and over fifty capabilities\n in its role-based access system. Plugins can modify the system.\n\n Related article: Roles and Capabilities External link: Role-based access control (Wikipedia)\nScreen\nIn WordPress a screen is a web page used for managing part of a weblog (site) or network. The term ‘screen’ is used to avoid confusion with ‘page‘, which has a specific and different meaning in WordPress. For example, the web page used to manage posts is known as the Posts Screen.\n\n Related article: Class_Reference/WP_Screen\nSerialization\nThe process of converting a block’s attributes object into HTML markup, which occurs each time a block is edited.\nSettings Sidebar\nThe panel on the right that contains the document and block settings. The sidebar is toggled using the Settings gear icon. Block settings are shown when a block is selected, otherwise document settings are shown.\nShell\nA shell is a program which interacts directly with an operating system such as MS-DOS, Unix/Linux, Mac OS X, or others — but it is most commonly associated with Unices.\n It is often referred to as a ‘console’ or ‘command line’, because it is\n controlled using typed commands rather than mouse or graphical\ninterface input.\n\nMost often, when interacting with a remote computer (as one would\n when configuring WordPress), an additional “faux” shell is involved\ncalled SSH.\n\nSome popular shell programs are:\n\n Bash (Bourne Again Shell) Tcsh (an expanded C Shell) Zsh\nShortcode\nA Shortcode is a technique for embedding a snippet of PHP code into the body of a page or other content item.\n\nSidebar\nA sidebar is a vertical column provided by a theme for displaying information other than the main content of the web page. Themes usually provide at least one sidebar at the left or right of the content. Sidebars usually contain widgets that an administrator of the site can customize.\n\nIn a theme, sidebars are generated by a template file, typically named sidebar.php.\n\n See also: Footer area Related articles: Sidebars, Templates, Customizing Your Sidebar, Stepping Into Templates, Template Hierarchy\nSite\nIn the WordPress user interface, a site can simply be the website created by WordPress, or it can be a virtual website created as part of a network by the multisite\n feature. A site in a network is virtual in the sense that it does not\nhave its own directory on the server, although it has its own URL and it\n might have its own domain name.\n\nIn WordPress code the site is the website created by WordPress.\nIf multisite is in use, then the site is the network website and each\nvirtual website is known as a blog.\n\n Related article: Create A Network\nSite Editor\nThe cohesive experience that allows you to directly edit and navigate between various templates, template parts, styling options, and more.\nSlug\nA slug is a few words that describe a post or a page. Slugs\nare usually a URL friendly version of the post title (which has been\nautomatically generated by WordPress), but a slug can be anything you\nlike.  Slugs are meant to be used with permalinks as they help describe what the content at the URL is.\n\nExample post permalink: https://wordpress.org/development/2006/06/wordpress-203/\n\nThe slug for that post is “wordpress-203”.\n\nSlugs are also used for post types, categories, tags, etc. Like\npost and page slugs, this is usually for creating URL friendly versions\nof these items.\n\nSmileys\n\nSmileys (also called Smilies or Emoticons) are stylized\nrepresentations of a human face, usually displayed as yellow buttons\nwith two dots for the eyes, and a half mouth. Smileys are often used in\nWordPress Plugins.  By default, WordPress automatically converts text\nsmileys to graphic images. When you type 😉 in your post you see  when you preview or publish your post.\n\nRelated article: Using Smilies\n\nSpam\nOnce upon a time, SPAM\n was an animal by-product that came in a can and was fodder for many\nMonty Python sketches, but since the world-wide adoption of the internet\n as an integral part of daily life, Spam has become synonymous with what\n is wrong with the internet. Spam, in general terms, is an email or\nother forms of unsolicited advertising. Spam is very easy to spread\nthroughout the internet, and works on the principle that if you send out\n thousands, or hundreds of thousands of unsolicited advertisements,\nscams, or other questionable methods of making money, that you only need\n a very small percentage of people to be fooled and you will make lots\nof money.\n\nCommon spam these days comes from online gambling sites and those\n trying to sell drugs for “male enhancement.” Lately, web logs, or\nblogs, as we call them, have been targeted by spammers to try to\nincrease their site ratings in the search engines. Spammers use various\nmethods to distribute their electronic junk mail, and employ bots, or\ncomputer programs to quickly and easily send email or comments to\nmillions of addresses and IPs all over the world.\n\nSpammers can be difficult to track down as they often hijack peoples’ email and IP addresses. When this happens, it may appear a friend sent you the spam, but in fact, the spammer’s bot grabbed your friend’s email address and used it to hide the true source of the spam. WordPress developers and community members are constantly working on more and better ways to combat these annoying spammers\n as they clog the internet with their garbage. You can help by offering\nyour talents, ideas, suggestions, or just by being vigilant and\ninstalling any of the currently-available spam combating tools.\n\n External links: SPAM at Wikipedia\nSSH\nSSH stands for Secure Shell. It is a communication protocol\nfor connecting to remote computers over TCP/IP. Various authentication\nmethods can be used which make SSH more secure than Telnet.\n\nSSL\nSSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and is the predecessor to\nTransport Layer Security. These are cryptographic protocols for secure\ncommunications across an unsecured network like the Internet.\n\n External links: SSL at Wikipedia\nStatic block\nA type of block where the content of which is known at the time of saving a post. A static block will be saved with HTML markup directly in post content.\nStats\nStats are a record showing how many views and visitors a\nWordPress blog or website gets during a set period of time. Stats also\nshow where in the world your viewers are.\n\nString\nIn computer science a string is any finite sequence of characters\n(i.e., letters, numerals, symbols and punctuation marks).\nTypically, programmers must enclose strings in quotation marks for the\ndata to be recognized as a string and not a number or variable name.\n\n External links: String at Wikipedia\nStructure tags\nThese tags are used to customize WordPress permalinks. Structure tags are:\n%year%, %day%, %hour%, %minute%, %second%, %post_id%, %postname%, %category% and %author%.\nEnd permalink structure with either %post_id% or %postname%, so that each permalink points to an individual post.\n\n Related articles: Permalinks\nSubversion\nSubversion is an open-source version control software tool used by the WordPress Developers to maintain and track the changes and updates to the various WordPress versions.\n\n Related articles: Using Subversion External links: Subversion access at wordpress.org, Subversion book at red-bean.com\nSVC\nSVC stands for Switched Virtual Circuit. An SVC is a virtual\ncircuit that is temporary turned on during a session of data transfer.\n\n External links: Virtual circuit at Wikipedia\nSyndication\nSee RSS: Really Simple Syndication\n\nBack to the Top\nTag\nA Tag is a keyword which describes all or part of a Post. Think of it like a Category,\n but smaller in scope. A Post may have several tags, many of which\nrelate to it only peripherally. Like Categories, Tags are usually linked\n to a page which shows all Posts having the same Tag. Tags can be\ncreated on-the-fly by simply typing them into the Tag field. By default, tags can be assigned only to the Post and custom post types.\n\nTags can also be displayed in clouds\n which show large numbers of Tags in various sizes, colors, etc. This\nallows for a sort of total perspective on the blog, allowing people to\nsee the sort of things your blog is about most.\n\nMany people confuse Tags and Categories, but the difference is\neasy: Categories generally don’t change often, while your Tags usually\nchange with every Post and are closer to the topic of the Post.\n\nTagline\nA tagline is a catchy phrase that describes the character or the\nattributes of the blog in a brief, concise manner. Think of it as the\nslogan, or catchline for a weblog.\n\nTask Based Documentation\nTask based, or task oriented documentation is writing that takes you\nthrough a process/task step-by-step; it is succinct, lacks jargon, is\neasily understood, and structured entirely around performing specific\ntasks.\n\nIn order to get to Z, you need to:\n\nStep xStep yStep z\nKeep in mind that people who need to know how to perform a task usually need answers quick!\n\nTaxonomy\nA taxonomy allows for the classification of things.  In\nWordPress, there are two built-in taxonomies, categories and tags.\nThese taxonomies help further classify posts and custom post types.\nAlso, custom taxonomies can be defined.\n\n See also: Category, Tag External links: Taxonomy at Wikipedia, register_taxonomy()\nTelnet\nTelnet is a communications protocol used to establish a connection to another computer.  Telnet runs on top of TCP/IP\n and is typically used in conjuction with terminal emulation software to\n login to remote computers. Telnet is inherently insecure and has\nlargely been replaced by SSH\n\n External links: Telnet at Wikipedia\nTemplate\nIn WordPress a template is a file that defines an area of the web pages generated by a theme. For example, there is typically a template for the header area at the top of the web pages, a template for the content, a template for the sidebars, and so on. The templates are like building blocks that make up the complete web page.\n\n Related articles: Templates, Stepping Into Templates, Template Hierarchy\nTemplate Editing Mode\nA scaled down direct editing experience allowing you to edit/change/create the template a post/page uses.\nTemplate Tag\nIn a WordPress Theme, template tags\n are used in template files to generate specific programming\ninstructions. They are used to display generated content and information\n on a WordPress site. Template tags are short programming words, also\nknown as functions, that tap into the WordPress core for instructions.\nFor example, the HTML title tag of a WordPress site may hold the bloginfo()\n template tag that requests the site title, site tagline, and other site\n information set by the template tag parameters. Using this in the title HTML tag allows the Theme to be used on multiple sites and the information displayed will change easily with each site.\n\nOther template tags are more sophisticated, generating post content, queries, and site data.\n\n Related articles: Stepping Into Template Tags, Anatomy of a Template Tag, How to Pass Tag Parameters, Include Tags, Conditional Tags, Function Reference, Templates\nTerm\nIn WordPress, a term is a classification, group or subset of a Taxonomy, where the latter can be a Category, Tag\n or Custom Taxonomy. By default, terms have a title, a slug and a\ndescription. Hierarchical taxonomies like categories can define a parent\n term.\n\n Related articles: Taxonomies, the_terms()\nText editor\nA text editor is a program which edits files in plain text format, as compared to binary format.  Using a non-text based word processing program (e.g. using Microsoft Word to edit PHP\n scripts) can cause major problems in your code. This is because\nnon-text based word processing programs insert extra formatting into\ntext files, and can corrupt the files when they need to be interpreted\nby the interpreter. An editor like Notepad does not insert any extra\nformatting.\n\nEdit WordPress Files with a text only editor.\n\nSome examples of file formats which need to be edited as plain text:\n\n HTML documents PHP scripts Perl scripts Rich Text Format documents JavaScript scripts\nFor our recommended Text Editors, please see Editing Files.\nSome examples of non-plain text formats that require special software for editing:\n\n Microsoft Word documents Microsoft Excel spreadsheets Images, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF\nSome examples of software which can edit text, but which are NOT regarded as basic text editors and NOT recommended for use on WordPress files:\n\n Microsoft Word Microsoft Excel Adobe Photoshop Adobe Illustrator Adobe Dreamweaver\nTheme\nA Theme is a collection of files that work together to produce a\ngraphical front-end interface with an underlying unifying design for a\nsite. A WordPress Theme modifies the way the site is displayed and\ndesigned, without modifying the underlying core programming of\nWordPress. While some associate a WordPress Theme with “skinning” your\nsite with a design, a WordPress Theme contains programming code that\ninfluences the design, changing it with each generated page view based\nupon the programming with PHP, WordPress template tags, WordPress\nconditional tags, and CSS.\n\n Related articles: Theme Development, Using Themes\nTheme Blocks\nBlocks that accomplish everything possible in traditional templates using template tags (ex: Post Author Block).

The Toolbar was added in Version 3.1 as Admin Bar and in Version 3.3 it was replaced by the Toolbar.  The toolbar can be turned on/off from the User Profile Screen.\n\n Related articles: Toolbar See also: Admin Bar, Your Profile Screen\nToolbar (in FSE)\nA set of button controls. In the context of a block, usually referring to the toolbar of block controls shown above the selected block.\nTrackback\nTrackback helps you to notify another author that you wrote something\n related to what he had written on his blog, even if you don’t have an\nexplicit link to his article. This improves the chances of the other\nauthor sitting up and noticing that you gave him credit for something,\nor that you improved upon something he wrote, or something similar. With\n pingback and trackback, blogs are interconnected. Think of them as the\nequivalents of acknowledgements and references at the end of an academic\n paper, or a chapter in a textbook.\n\n See also: Pingback Related articles: Introduction to Blogging: Trackbacks\nTransient\nA Transient is temporal data identified by a custom name, stored in the web server database or memory for fast access. This temporal nature and use of fast memory caching is their primary distinction from Options.\n\n Related articles: Transients API, Options API\nUnicode\nA widely supported and preferred character encoding system.\n\nFor a computer to display letters (or any text characters), it\nneeds to enumerate them – create an index of characters it knows how to\ndisplay. These indexes are known as character sets. This is invaluable\nfor users hosting WordPress in a non-English language.\n\nThe most widely used collections of these character sets are the iso-8859 with iso-8859-1 and iso-8859-15  (which contains the euro sign) being the most common; they are also known as  Latin1 and Latin9. These character sets use 8 bits (a single byte) for  each character, allowing for 255 different characters (256, counting  null). However, when considering that Latin-based languages aren’t the  only ones in the world (think Japanese or Hebrew), 255 characters aren’t  nearly enough. \nThere is a wide index of characters known as Unicode.\n Unicode has so many characters that sometimes more than 16 bits (2\nbytes!) are required to represent them. Furthermore, the first 127\ncharacters of Unicode are the same as the first 127 of the most widely\nused character set – iso-8859-1. For this purpose, UTF, the Unicode\nTranslation Format, was created. UTF uses different numbers of bits for\ncharacters, and allows for the entire range of Unicode to be used. What\nyou should probably know is:\n\n UTF-8 is an 8-bit-minimum type of UTF. There are also UTF-16 and UTF-32. If your document is in a Latin-based encoding, you probably don’t need to change anything about it for it to be UTF. A single UTF document can be in various languages with no need to switch encodings halfway through. External links: Joel Spolsky on Unicode\nUnix\nUnix, or UNIX, is a computer operating system developed\n at AT&T’s Bell Laboratories starting back in 1969. Initially\ndesigned with the objective of creating an OS written in a high level\nlanguage rather than assembly, a majority of web servers currently run on different “flavors” of this high-performance OS, or on Linux, developed as a Unix-like operating system.\n\n See also: UNIX Shell Skills, Mac OS X\nUnix Time\nUnix Time, or a timestamp, is a method of tracking time\n by determining the approximate number of seconds from a particular\nevent.

The most common web server software on the internet is Apache, which is frequently used in conjunction with PHP, Perl, and other scripting languages.\n\nIt is possible to create one’s own web server, hosted on any\nspeed of internet connection, but many people choose to purchase\npackages from hosting providers,\n who have the capacity and facilities to provide adequate bandwidth,\nuptime, hardware, and maintenance for frequently-visited web sites.\n\n Related articles: Hosting WordPress\nWidget\nIn WordPress a widget is a self-contained area of a web page\nthat performs a specific function, or the code that generates such a\nself-contained area. For example, WordPress has a built-in widget that\ndisplays a list of pages in a weblog’s sidebar, and it has another built-in widget that displays a list of recent comments in the Dashboard. Plugins and themes can provide additional widgets.\n\n Related articles: WordPress Widgets, Widgets API, Dashboard Widgets API\nWidget Area\nFurthermore, a “Widget Area” is a pre-defined location, in the code\nof your WordPress Theme, that allows users to place Widgets into.\n\nXFN\nThe XHTML Friends Network.

In such situations modification of the text is not desirable because it might create syntactically incorrect code.\nA few examples include:\n\"quoted text\" becomes “quoted text”\n'quoted text' becomes ‘quoted text’\n          --- becomes —\n           -- becomes –\n          ... becomes …\n          (c) becomes ©\n          (r) becomes ®\n         (tm) becomes ™\n           '' becomes ”\n           `` becomes “\n  president's becomes president’s\n  presidents' becomes presidents’\n          12' becomes 12′\n          12\" becomes 12″\n          2x4 becomes 2×4\n\nConvert Smilies\nThe convert_smilies() function converts combinations of characters into smilies or emoticons within the post, page, and comment text. For example, if smilies are enabled, WordPress will recognize “:” and “D” (:D) and turn it into a smiling face ( 😀 ).\nThe key to making smilies work is to put a space before and after the keystroke combination. If placed up against the text, it will not convert.\nIf conversion of smilies is not desired, turn it off through the Settings > Writing panel.\nConvert Characters\nThe formatting.php code file contains numerous functions which help publish character entities, accents, and non-English characters to a form recognizable by the web browser.\nGenerally, these work excellently, however, your browser may not recognize various language characters unless that language is activated in your web browser. See your browser’s documentation for more information on adding language character recognition to your browser.\nMethods to Prevent Processing\nThere are a variety of Plugins to change the filtering process WordPress uses by default. It is highly recommended that you do not change the core programming but use WordPress Plugins to change all or some of the content processing. See the WordPress Plugins Directory for various Plugins that change the post content filtering process.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/how-wordpress-processes-post-content/", "title": "How WordPress Processes Post Content – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "WordPress processes text entered in the Write Post Screen multiple times before the text is finally displayed on a web page within your WordPress blog.

{"text": "\nWARNING: The upgrade process will affect all files and folders included in the main WordPress installation. This includes all the core files used to run WordPress. If you have made any modifications to those files, your changes will be lost.\nYou should always update WordPress to the latest version. When a new version of WordPress is available you will receive an update message in your WordPress Admin Screens. To update WordPress, click the link in this message.\nThere are two methods for updating – the easiest is the one-click update, which will work for most people. If it doesn’t work, or you just prefer to be more hands-on, you can follow the manual update process.\nIf you are updating across multiple versions, follow the procedure at Upgrading WordPress – Extended Instructions\nBack up WordPress\nBefore you get started, it’s a good idea to back up your website. This means if there are any issues you can restore your website. Complete instructions to make a backup can be found in the WordPress Backup.\nAutomatic Background Updates\nFor WordPress 3.7+, you don’t have to lift a finger to apply minor and security updates. Most sites are now able to automatically apply these updates in the background. If your site is capable of one-click updates without entering FTP credentials, then your site should be able to update from 3.7 to 3.7.1, 3.7.2, etc. (You’ll still need to click “Update Now” for major feature releases.)\nOne-click Update\nWordPress lets you update with the click of a button.  You can launch the update by clicking the link in the new version banner (if it’s there) or by going to the Dashboard > Updates screen. Once you are on the “Update WordPress” page, click the button “Update Now” to start the process off. You shouldn’t need to do anything else and, once it’s finished, you will be up-to-date.\nOne-click updates work on most servers. If you have any problems, it is probably related to permissions issues on the filesystem.\nFile Ownership\nWordPress determines what method it will use to connect to the filesystem of your server based on the file ownership of your WordPress files. If the files are owned by the owner of the current process (i.e., the user under which the web server is running), and new files created by WordPress will also be owned by that user, WordPress will directly modify the files all by itself, without asking you for credentials.\nWordPress won’t attempt to create the new files directly if they won’t have the correct ownership. Instead, you will be shown a dialog box asking for connection credentials. It is typical for the files to be owned by the FTP account that originally uploaded them. To perform the update, you just need to fill in the connection credentials for that FTP account.\nWhether your files are owned by the web server user, or not, will depend on how you installed WordPress and how your server is configured. On some shared hosting platforms, it is a security risk for the files to be owned by the web server user and not a FTP user. See the tutorial on Changing File Permissions for more information, including how to configure file permissions so that multiple FTP users are able to edit the files.\nFailed Updates\nIf you see a “failed update” nag message, delete the file .maintenance from your WordPress directory using FTP. This will remove the “failed update” nag message.\nIf the one-click upgrade doesn’t work for you, don’t panic! Just try a manual update.\nManual Update\nThese are the short instructions, if you want more check out the extended upgrade instructions. If you experience problems with the Three Step Update, you may want to review the more detailed upgrade instructions.\nFor these instructions, it is assumed that your blog’s URL is http://example.com/wordpress/.\nStep 1: Replace WordPress files\nGet the latest WordPress zip (or tar.gz) file.Unpack the zip file that you downloaded.Deactivate plugins.Delete the old wp-includes and wp-admin directories on your web host (through your FTP or shell access).Using FTP or your shell access, upload the new wp-includes and wp-admin directories to your web host, in place of the previously deleted directories.Upload the individual files from the new wp-content folder to your existing wp-content folder, overwriting existing files. Do NOT delete your existing wp-content folder. Do NOT delete any files or folders in your existing wp-content directory (except for the one being overwritten by new files).Upload all new loose files from the root directory of the new version to your existing WordPress root directory.\nNOTE – you should replace all the old WordPress files with the new ones in the wp-includes and wp-admin directories and sub-directories, and in the root directory (such as index.php, wp-login.php and so on). Don’t worry – your wp-config.php will be safe.\nBe careful when you come to copying the wp-content directory. You should make sure that you only copy the files from inside this directory, rather than replacing your entire wp-content directory. This is where your themes and plugins live, so you will want to keep them. If you have customized the default or classic themes without renaming them, make sure not to overwrite those files, otherwise you will lose your changes. (Though you might want to compare them for new features or fixes..)\nLastly you should take a look at the wp-config-sample.php file, to see if any new settings have been introduced that you might want to add to your own wp-config.php.\nStep 1.5: Remove .maintenance file\nIf you’re upgrading manually after a failed auto-upgrade, delete the file .maintenance from your WordPress directory using FTP. This will remove the “failed update” nag message.\nStep 2: Update your installation\nVisit your main WordPress admin page at /wp-admin. You may be asked to login again. If a database upgrade is necessary at this point, WordPress will detect it and give you a link to a URL like http://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/upgrade.php. Follow that link and follow the instructions. This will update your database to be compatible with the latest code. You should do this as soon as possible after step 1.\nDon’t forget to reactivate plugins!\nStep 3: Do something nice for yourself\nIf you have caching enabled, clear the cache at this point so the changes will go live immediately. Otherwise, visitors to your site (including you) will continue to see the old version (until the cache updates).\nYour WordPress installation is successfully updated. That’s as simple as we can make it without Updating WordPress Using Subversion.\nConsider rewarding yourself with a blog post about the update, reading that book or article you’ve been putting off, or simply sitting back for a few moments and letting the world pass you by.\nFinal Steps\nYour update is now complete, so you can go in and enable your Plugins again.If you have issues with logging in, try clearing cookies in your browser.\nTroubleshooting\nIf anything has gone wrong, then the first thing to do is go through all the steps in our extended upgrade instructions. That page also has information about some of the most common problems we see.\nIf you run into a request for FTP credentials with trying to update WP on a IIS server automatically, it may well be a matter of rights. Go into the IIS Management Console, and there to the application pool of your blog. In its advanced settings, change the Process Model Id into LocalSystem. Then on Sites, choose your blog, right click, click on Edit permissions and on security tab add authenticated users. That should do it.\nIf you experience problems after the upgrade, you can always restore your backup and replace the files with ones from your previous version from the release archive.\nOther options\nIf you have some knowledge of unix shells you should check out wp-cli.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/updating-wordpress/", "title": "Updating WordPress – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "WARNING: The upgrade process will affect all files and folders included in the main WordPress installation.

{"text": "\nWhat is a “blog”?\n“Blog” is an abbreviated version of “weblog,” which is a term used to describe websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information. A blog features diary-type commentary and links to articles on other websites, usually presented as a list of entries in reverse chronological order. Blogs range from the personal to the political, and can focus on one narrow subject or a whole range of subjects.\nMany blogs focus on a particular topic, such as web design, home staging, sports, or mobile technology. Some are more eclectic, presenting links to all types of other sites. And others are more like personal journals, presenting the author’s daily life and thoughts.\nGenerally speaking (although there are exceptions), blogs tend to have a few things in common:\n\nA main content area with articles listed chronologically, newest on top. Often, the articles are organized into categories.An archive of older articles.A way for people to leave comments about the articles.A list of links to other related sites, sometimes called a “blogroll”.One or more “feeds” like RSS, Atom or RDF files.\nSome blogs may have additional features beyond these. Watch this short video for a simple explanation for what a blog is.\nWhat is a “blogger”?\n\nA blogger is a person who owns or runs a blog or a person who maintains the blog. That is, posting articles or new posts, information, sharing the most up-to-date news, opinions and case studies to name but a few. Such entries are known as blog posts.\n\nThe Blog Content\nContent is the raison d’être for any website. Retail sites feature a catalog of products. University sites contain information about their campuses, curriculum, and faculty. News sites show the latest news stories. For a personal blog, you might have a bunch of observations, or reviews. Without some sort of updated content, there is little reason to visit a website more than once.\nOn a blog, the content consists of articles (also sometimes called “posts” or “entries”) that the author(s) writes. Yes, some blogs have multiple authors, each writing his/her own articles. Typically, blog authors compose their articles in a web-based interface, built into the blogging system itself. Some blogging systems also support the ability to use stand-alone “weblog client” software, which allows authors to write articles offline and upload them at a later time.\nComments\nWant an interactive website? Wouldn’t it be nice if the readers of a website could leave comments, tips or impressions about the site or a specific article? With blogs, they can! Posting comments is one of the most exciting features of blogs.\nMost blogs have a method to allow visitors to leave comments. There are also nifty ways for authors of other blogs to leave comments without even visiting the blog! Called “pingbacks” or “trackbacks“, they can inform other bloggers whenever they cite an article from another site in their own articles. All this ensures that online conversations can be maintained painlessly among various site users and websites.\nThe Difference Between a Blog and CMS?\nSoftware that provides a method of managing your website is commonly called a CMS or “Content Management System”. Many blogging software programs are considered a specific type of CMS. They provide the features required to create and maintain a blog, and can make publishing on the internet as simple as writing an article, giving it a title, and organizing it under (one or more) categories. While some CMS programs offer vast and sophisticated features, a basic blogging tool provides an interface where you can work in an easy and, to some degree, intuitive manner while it handles the logistics involved in making your composition presentable and publicly available. In other words, you get to focus on what you want to write, and the blogging tool takes care of the rest of the site management.\n WordPress is one such advanced blogging tool and it provides a rich set of features. Through its Administration Screen, you can set options for the behavior and presentation of your weblog. Via these Administration Screen, you can easily compose a blog post, push a button, and be published on the internet, instantly! WordPress goes to great pains to see that your blog posts look good, the text looks beautiful, and the html code it generates conforms to web standards.\nIf you’re just starting out, read Getting Started with WordPress, which contains information on how to get WordPress set up quickly and effectively, as well as information on performing basic tasks within WordPress, like creating new posts or editing existing ones.\nThings Bloggers Need to Know\n\nIn addition to understanding how your specific blogging software works, such as WordPress, there are some terms and concepts you need to know.\n\nArchives\nA blog is also a good way to keep track of articles on a site. A lot of blogs feature an archive based on dates (like a monthly or yearly archive). The front page of a blog may feature a calendar of dates linked to daily archives. Archives can also be based on categories featuring all the articles related to a specific category.\nIt does not stop there; you can also archive your posts by author or alphabetically. The possibilities are endless. This ability to organize and present articles in a composed fashion is much of what makes blogging a popular personal publishing tool.\nFeeds\nA Feed is a function of special software that allows “Feedreaders” to access a site automatically looking for new content and then post updates about that new content to another site. This provides a way for users to keep up with the latest and hottest information posted on different blogging sites. Some Feeds include RSS (alternately defined as “Rich Site Summary” or “Really Simple Syndication”), Atom or RDF files. Dave Shea has written a comprehensive summary of feeds.\nSyndication\n\nA feed is a machine readable (usually XML) content publication that is updated regularly. Many weblogs publish a feed (usually RSS, but also possibly Atom and RDF and so on, as described above). There are tools out there that call themselves “feedreaders”. What they do is they keep checking specified blogs to see if they have been updated, and when the blogs are updated, they display the new post, and a link to it, with an excerpt (or the whole contents) of the post. Each feed contains items that are published over time. When checking a feed, the feedreader is actually looking for new items. New items are automatically discovered and downloaded for you to read, so you don’t have to visit all the blogs you are interested in. All you have to do with these feedreaders is to add the link to the RSS feed of all the blogs you are interested in. The feedreader will then inform you when any of the blogs have new posts in them. Most blogs have these “Syndication” feeds available for the readers to use.\n\nManaging Comments\n\nOne of the most exciting features of blogging tools are the comments. This highly interactive feature allows users to comment upon article posts, link to your posts, and comment on and recommend them. These are known as trackbacks and pingbacks. We’ll also discuss how to moderate and manage comments and how to deal with the annoying trend in “comment spam”, when unwanted comments are posted to your blog.\n\nTrackbacks\nTrackbacks were originally developed by SixApart, creators of the MovableType blog package. SixApart has a good introduction to trackbacks:\nIn a nutshell, TrackBack was designed to provide a method of notification between websites: it is a method of person A saying to person B, “This is something you may be interested in.” To do that, person A sends a TrackBack ping to person B.\n\nA better explanation is this:\n\nPerson A writes something on their blog.Person B wants to comment on Person A’s blog, but wants her own readers to see what she had to say, and be able to comment on her own blogPerson B posts on her own blog and sends a trackback to Person A’s blogPerson A’s blog receives the trackback, and displays it as a comment to the original post. This comment contains a link to Person B’s post\nThe idea here is that more people are introduced to the conversation (both Person A’s and Person B’s readers can follow links to the other’s post), and that there is a level of authenticity to the trackback comments because they originated from another weblog. Unfortunately, there is no actual verification performed on the incoming trackback, and indeed they can even be faked.\nMost trackbacks send to Person A only a small portion (called an “excerpt”) of what Person B had to say. This is meant to act as a “teaser”, letting Person A (and his readers) see some of what Person B had to say, and encouraging them all to click over to Person B’s site to read the rest (and possibly comment).\nPerson B’s trackback to Person A’s blog generally gets posted along with all the comments. This means that Person A can edit the contents of the trackback on his own server, which means that the whole idea of “authenticity” isn’t really solved. (Note: Person A can only edit the contents of the trackback on his own site. He cannot edit the post on Person B’s site that sent the trackback.)\nSixApart has published an official trackback specification.\nPingbacks\nPingbacks were designed to solve some of the problems that people saw with trackbacks. That is why the official pingback documentation sounds so much like the description of a trackback:\nFor example, Yvonne writes an interesting article on her Web log. Kathleen reads Yvonne’s article and comments about it, linking back to Yvonne’s original post. Using pingback, Kathleen’s software can automatically notify Yvonne that her post has been linked to, and Yvonne’s software can then include this information on her site.\n\nThe best way to think about pingbacks is as remote comments:\n\nPerson A posts something on his blog.Person B posts on her own blog, linking to Person A’s post. This automatically sends a pingback to Person A when both have pingback enabled blogs.Person A’s blog receives the pingback, then automatically goes to Person B’s post to confirm that the pingback did, in fact, originate there.\nThe pingback is generally displayed on Person A’s blog as simply a link to Person B’s post. It is commonly believed that pingbacks do not send any content, as trackbacks do. This is not correct. If you get a pingback, you will see an excerpt from that blog in the Edit Comments section of your dashboard. The issue is that very few themes display these excerpts from pingbacks. The default WordPress themes, for example, do not display pingback excerpts.\nIn fact, there is only one significant difference between pingbacks and trackbacks: Pingbacks and trackbacks use drastically different communication technologies (XML-RPC and HTTP POST, respectively). But that difference is important because trackbacks have become the target of so much spam. The automatic verification process introduces a level of authenticity, making it harder to fake a pingback.\nSome feel that trackbacks are superior because readers of Person A’s blog can at least see some of what Person B has to say, and then decide if they want to read more (and therefore click over to Person B’s blog). Others feel that pingbacks are superior because they create a verifiable connection between posts.\nUsing Pingbacks and Trackbacks\nComments on blogs are often criticized as lacking authority, since anyone can post anything using any name they like: there’s no verification process to ensure that the person is who they claim to be. Trackbacks and Pingbacks both aim to provide some verification to blog commenting.\nTo enable trackbacks and pingbacks, in the Discussion Settings of your Administration Screen, select these items under ‘Default article settings’:\nAttempt to notify any blogs linked to from the article.\nAllow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles.\nSelecting one option and not the other would not be very neighborly 😉\nOnce enabled, trackbacks and pingbacks from other sites will appear in your Administration Screen just like other comments, but on your post pages, they will appear according to your theme’s design.\nOnce enabled, pingbacks are sent automatically when you publish your post, you don’t have to do anything. To send trackbacks, you will need to find the trackback URL somewhere on the post page you are linking to. If you can’t find one, try to determine if the site supports pingbacks. If it does, you should not send trackbacks as well. Copy/paste the trackback URL into the Send Trackbacksfield on your Add New Post screen. If you don’t see this field, go to the screen options and select the Send Trackbacks option. Note that selecting this does not send trackbacks, it only displays the field called Send Trackbacks. When you publish your post, trackbacks will be sent to the URLs you pasted into the field. This field will also show the status of trackbacks and pingbacks on your Edit Post screen.\nIf there is someone that wants to send a trackback to your WordPress blog because their blogging software does not support pingbacks, your trackback URL they should insert into their post edit screen is your blog post’s permalink with “trackback/” appended to the end. If their software supports pingbacks, they do not need to do anything, the process is automatic.\nComment Moderation\nComment Moderation is a feature which allows the website owner and author to monitor and control the comments on the different article posts, and can help in tackling comment spam. It lets you moderate comments, & you can delete unwanted comments, approve cool comments and make other decisions about the comments.\n\nComment Spam\nComment Spam refers to useless comments (or trackbacks, or pingbacks) to posts on a blog. These are often irrelevant to the context value of the post. They can contain one or more links to other websites or domains. Spammers use Comment Spam as a medium to get higher page rank for their domains in Google, so that they can sell those domains at a higher price sometime in future or to obtain a high ranking in search results for an existing website.\nSpammers are relentless; because there can be substantial money involved, they work hard at their “job.” They even build automated tools (robots) to rapidly submit their spam to the same or multiple weblogs. Many webloggers, especially beginners, sometimes feel overwhelmed by Comment Spam.\nThere are solutions, though, to avoiding Comment Spam. WordPress includes many tools for combating Comment Spam. With a little up front effort, Comment Spam can be manageable, and certainly no reason to give up weblogging.\nPretty Permalinks\nPermalinks are the permanent URLs to your individual weblog posts, as well as categories and other lists of weblog postings. A permalink is what another weblogger will use to refer to your article (or section), or how you might send a link to your story in an e-mail message. Because others may link to your individual postings, the URL to that article shouldn’t change. Permalinks are intended to be permanent (valid for a long time).\n“Pretty” Permalinks is the idea that URLs are frequently visible to the people who click them, and should therefore be crafted in such a way that they make sense, and not be filled with incomprehensible parameters. The best Permalinks are “hackable,” meaning a user might modify the link text in their browser to navigate to another section or listing of the weblog. For example, this is how the default Permalink to a story might look in a default WordPress installation:\n/index.php?p=423\nHow is a user to know what “p” represents? Where did the number 423 come from?\nIn contrast, here is a well-structured, “Pretty” Permalink which could link to the same article, once the installation is configured to modify permalinks:\n/archives/2003/05/23/my-cheese-sandwich/\nOne can easily guess that the Permalink includes the date of the posting, and the title, just by looking at the URL. One might also guess that hacking the URL to be /archives/2003/05/ would get a list of all the postings from May of 2003 (pretty cool). For more information on possible Permalink patterns in WordPress, see Using Permalinks.\nBlog by email\n\nSome blogging tools offer the ability to email your posts directly to your blog, all without direct interaction through the blogging tool interface. WordPress offers this cool feature. Using email, you can now send in your post content to a pre-determined email address & voila! Your post is published!\n\nPost Slugs\n\nIf you’re using Pretty Permalinks, the Post Slug is the title of your article post within the link. The blogging tool software may simplify or truncate your title into a more appropriate form for using as a link. A title such as “I’ll Make A Wish” might be truncated to “ill-make-a-wish”. In WordPress, you can change the Post Slug to something else, like “make-a-wish”, which sounds better than a wish made when sick.\n\nExcerpt\nExcerpts are condensed summaries of your blog posts, with blogging tools being able to handle these in various ways. In WordPress, Excerpts can be specifically written to summarize the post, or generated automatically by using the first few paragraphs of a post or using the post up to a specific point, assigned by you.\nPlugins\nPlugins are cool bits of programming scripts that add additional functionality to your blog. These are often features which either enhance already available features or add them to your site.\nWordPress offers simple and easy ways of adding Administration Screen, there is a Plugins Screen. You can easily search, install and activate Plugins from this Screen.\nBasics – A Few Blogging Tips\n\nStarting a new blog is difficult and this can put many people off. Some may get off to a good start only to become quickly discouraged because of the lack of comments or visits. You want to stand out from this crowd of millions of bloggers, you want to be one of the few hundred thousand blogs that are actually visited. Here are some simple tips to help you on your way to blogging mastery:\n\nPost regularly, but don’t post if you have nothing worth posting about.Stick with only a few specific genres to talk about.Don’t put ‘subscribe’ and ‘vote me’ links all over the front page until you have people that like your blog enough to ignore them (they’re usually just in the way).Use a clean and simple theme if at all possible.Enjoy, blog for fun, comment on other peoples’ blogs (as they normally visit back).Have fun blogging and remember, there are no rules to what you post on your blog!\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/introduction-to-blogging/", "title": "Introduction to Blogging – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "What is a \"blog\"? \"Blog\" is an abbreviated version of \"weblog,\" which is a term used to describe websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information.

WordPress automatically notifies popular Update Services that you’ve updated your blog by sending a XML-RPC ping each time you create or update a post.  In turn, Update Services process the ping and updates their proprietary indices with your update. \nCommon Usage\nMost people use Ping-o-Matic which, with just one “ping” from you, will let many other services know that you’ve updated. As for why, Ping-O-Matic puts it best:\nSo why would you want to be on these sites? One word: traffic. Blogrolling scripts like WordPress check update services to see if you’ve updated and then shows it on everyone’s site — usually by moving you to the top of people’s blogrolling list or putting a recently updated indicator by your link. Services spider your links to track who links to you and who you link to; almost in real time. If you show up on someone’s link list, they’re likely to visit your site to see what you said, increasing your exposure. Sites like weblogs.com and blo.gs list recently updated blogs.  Lots of people browse these when they’re bored. Many of the services offer their own forms for pinging their own service, but keeping track of all those services is a hassle.\nIf you do not want the update services to be pinged, remove all the update service URIs listed under “Update Services” on the Settings->Writing administration screen of your WordPress installation.\n\nCertain web hosts – particularly free ones – disable the PHP functions used to alert update services. If your web host prevents pings, you should stop WordPress from attempting to ping.\nXML-RPC Ping Services\nhttp://rpc.pingomatic.com\nhttp://rpc.twingly.com\nhttp://www.blogdigger.com/RPC2\nhttp://ping.blo.gs/\nhttp://ping.feedburner.com\nhttp://rpc.weblogs.com/RPC2\nhttp://www.pingmyblog.com\nAlternatives\nAn alternative is Feed Shark, which pings over 60 services for free.\nWordPress Multisite Network\nBy default, editing the Ping Services for a WordPress Multisite network site is disabled.

{"text": "\nPermalinks are the permanent URLs of your posts, pages, categories, and other archive pages on your website. These URLs are permanent and should never be changed — hence the name permalink.\nPermalinks help to create a URL structure that is easy for both humans and search engines to understand and share.\n\nA permalink is used when another blogger wants to link to your article.\nYou share the permalink when you want to share your content on social media. \nWhen Google wants to index your article, they use the permalink of the content. \nWhen you want to share a blog post with your friend, you send the permalink of your content in an email.\n\nPermalink Types\nThere are three types of WordPress permalinks:\nPlain Permalinks\nThe default Plain Permalink also called the Ugly Permalink looks like this:\nhttp://example.com/?p=N\nwith p as the parameter and N is the unique ID of the post or page in the database. \nWordPress comes preinstalled with this setting. It works on all server environments. It is not user-friendly and also not optimized for search engines.\nPretty Permalinks\nPretty Permalinks are SEO-friendly and attractive. They usually contain several words such as the title of the post or page, post category, tag name, etc. You can use Keywords in the URL to make your content readable by search engines. \nPretty Permalinks also help others get an understanding of what the content of the page or post is by reading the URL. \nPretty Permalinks look like this:\nhttp://example.com/2012/post-name/\nor\nhttp://example.com/2012/12/30/post-name\nAlmost Pretty Permalinks\nWordPress provides a third option called the Almost Pretty permalinks. These permalinks have /index.php prefixed before them, like so:\nhttp://example.com/index.php/yyyy/mm/dd/post-name/\nExcept for this detail, they are similar to Pretty Permalinks. \nChoosing your permalink structure\nOn the WordPress dashboard, go to Settings →︎ Permalinks Screen. You can choose one of the permalink structures or enter your own in the “Custom structure” field using the structure tags.\n\nThere are six options to select from:\nPlain: This is the Ugly Permalink setting.\nDay and name: This uses a year/month/date format followed by your post name. \nMonth and name: This uses a year/month format followed by your post name. \nNumeric: This option uses the ID of the post from the row in the wp_posts table of your database.\nPost name: This one uses the name of your post.\nCustom Structure: This field allows you to define your own custom URL structure using the structure tags available in WordPress.\nThe default setting is Plain, which is automatically configured when you install WordPress.\nNOTE:Your hosting provider should have set up the web servers with the necessary configurations for the Pretty and Almost Pretty Permalinks to work correctly. If they are not, then you need to contact your hosting provider.\nStructure Tags\nWordPress provides the following structure tags for creating your own custom permalinks. You can use these tags to customize your Pretty or Almost Pretty permalinks. \nNote: \n\nYou do not put your website URL in the permalinks fields. You only use one of the structure tags or a combination of tags.\nTo use the Almost Pretty Permalinks, start your permalink structure with index.php/.\nEnd your structure with either %post_id% or %postname% so that WordPress can target an individual post for every permalink. (E.g. /%year%/%monthnum%/%day%/%postname%/) \n\n%year%\nThe year of the post in four digits, eg:  2018\n%monthnum%\nMonth the post was published, in two digits, eg: 05\n%day%\nDay the post was published in two digits, eg: 28\n%hour%\nHour of the day, the post was published, eg: 15\n%minute%\nMinute of the hour, the post was published, eg:  43\n%second%\nSecond of the minute, the post was published, eg: 33\n%post_id%\nThe unique ID of the post, eg: 423\n%postname%\nA sanitized version of the title of the post (post slug field on Edit Post/Page panel). \nEg: “This Is A Great Post!” becomes this-is-a-great-post in the URI.\n%category%\nA sanitized version of the category name (category slug field on New/Edit Category panel). \nNested sub-categories appear as nested directories in the URI.\n%author%\nA sanitized version of the post author’s name.\nCategory base and Tag base\nYou also have the option of setting custom category and tag bases for your site on the same screen under the Optional settings section.\n\nThe Category base and Tag base are prefixes used in URLs for category and tag archives, which look like this: \nexample.net/category_base/category_name\nexample.net/tag_base/tag_name\nThe default values for Category base and Tag base are category and tag. You can change them, but you can’t remove them from the URLs altogether.\nUsing %category% with multiple categories on a post\nWhen you assign multiple categories to a post, only one can show up in the permalink. Which category gets displayed in the permalink is determined alphabetically.\nIf you want to choose which category shows up in the permalink, you can use one of the plugins from the plugin directory.\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/customize-permalinks/", "title": "Customize permalinks – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Permalinks are the permanent URLs of your posts, pages, categories, and other archive pages on your website.

{"text": "\n\nWarning: WordPress 5.9 is the last version with this screen available. In WordPress 6.0 and later managing menus is done via navigation block.\n\nThe Menu Screen enables the user to create a custom menu (also known as a navigation bar, navigation menu, or main menu). It is a section of the site that helps visitors to navigate the site. Depending on the theme used, typically a site will have one navigation menu, while some themes may enable secondary or footer menus. It is essential to have a simplified navigation menu, so as not to confuse your visitors.\nIn your menu, you can add different items such as links to pages, articles, categories, or custom links to the url of your choice, such as another site, and then choose the order of the items and their hierarchy (possibility of creating submenus). In short, your menu is fully customizable.\nThe Appearance Menu Screen is accessible from the Dashboard via Appearance > Menus.\n\nScreen options\nThe Screen Options allow you to choose which modules are displayed, or not displayed, in the underlying Screen. Clicking on the Screen Options tab shows a list of the possible modules and options with a check-box next to each. Check the box for each module or option you want displayed, or uncheck the box to not display that module. Click the Screen Options tab again to close the Screen Options.\nCertain modules, like Posts are hidden by default.\nCreating menus\nCreating Menu\n\nGo to the WordPress Dashboard.\nFrom the ‘Appearance’ menu on the left-hand side of the Dashboard, select the ‘Menus’ option to bring up the Menu Editor.\nClick the link Create a new menu at the top of the page.\nEnter a name for your new menu in the Menu Name box\nClick the Create Menu button.\n\nAdding items to a menu\nAdding Items to menu\nYou can add different item types into your menu, such as Pages, Categories, or even Custom Links. These are split between panes left of the menu you’re currently editing. An example on how to add link to a page:\n\nLocate the pane entitled Pages.\nWithin this pane, select the View All link to bring up a list of all the currently published Pages on your site.\nSelect the Pages that you want to add by clicking the checkbox next to each Page’s title.\nClick the Add to Menu button located at the bottom of this pane to add your selection(s) to the menu that you created in the previous step.\nClick the Save Menu button once you’ve added all the menu items you want.\n\nYour custom menu has now been saved.\nNote: The Screen Options allow you to choose which items you can use to add to a menu. Certain items, like Tags are hidden by default.\nDeleting a menu item\nDeleting a menu item\n\nLocate the menu item that you want to remove in the menu editor window\nClick on the arrow icon in the top right-hand corner of the menu item to expand it.\nClick on the Remove item. The menu item will be immediately removed.\nClick the Save Menu button to save your changes.\n\nDeleting menu items in bulk\n\nTo delete multiple menu items at once, click on the checkbox Bulk Select. \nSelect the checkbox next to each of the menu items you wish to delete. \nClick Remove Selected Items. This will delete the selected menu items from the menu in bulk.\n\n\nCreating Multi-level Menus\nWhen planning the structure of your menu, it helps to think of each menu item as a heading in a formal report document. In a formal report, main section headings (Level 1 headings) are the nearest to the left of the page; sub-section headings (Level 2 headings) are indented slightly further to the right; any other subordinate headings (Level 3, 4, etc) within the same section are indented even further to the right.\nThe WordPress menu editor allows you to create multi-level menus using a simple ‘drag and drop’ interface. Drag menu items up or down to change their order of appearance in the menu. Drag menu items left or right in order to create sub-levels within your menu.\nTo make one menu item a subordinate of another, you need to position the ‘child’ underneath its ‘parent’ and then drag it slightly to the right.\n\nPosition the mouse over the ‘child’ menu item.\nWhilst holding the left mouse button, drag it to the right.\nRelease the mouse button.\nRepeat these steps for each sub-menu item.\nClick the Save Menu button in the Menu Editor to save your changes.\n\n\nAdding your menu to your site\nIf your current theme supports custom menus, you will be able to add your new menu to one of the Theme Locations.\n\nScroll to the bottom of the menu editor window.\nUnder Menu Settings -> Display location, click the check box for the location where you want your menu to appear.\nClick Save Menu once you’ve made your selection.\n\nAdding your custom menu to your site\nIf your current theme does not support custom menus, you will need to add your new menu via the Custom Menu widget in the Appearance Widgets Screen.\nRearranging, configuring menu items\nOnce an item is added to a menu, those menu items can be rearranged. Placing the mouse cursor over the menu item title, when the mouse cursor changes to cross-arrow, hold the left mouse button down, drag the module to where you want to place it, then release the mouse button (this is called drag-and-drop). Remember you can drag a menu item slightly to the right of the menu item above it to create a hierarchy (parent/child) relationship in the menu.\nEach Menu Item has a configuration arrow on the right side of the Menu Item title, that when clicked opens the configuration box. Click the arrow a second time to close the configuration box. If you don’t see Link Target, Title Attribute, CSS Classes, Link Relationship (XFN), and Description, then under Screen Options make sure those boxes are checked to expose them here.\n\nThen configuration choices are:\nNavigation Label \nThe label for this particular menu item\nTitle Attribute \nThe attribute used when displaying the label\nOpen link in new tab \nClick the checkbox to open the menu item in a new tab\nCSS Classes \nOptional CSS Classes for this menu item\nLink Relationship (XFN) \nAllows for the generation of XFN attributes automatically so you can show how you are related to the authors/owners of site to which you are linking. See Link Relationship for details.\nDescription \nDescription for this link.

{"text": "\nWordPress, straight out of the box, comes ready to embrace search engines. Its features and functions guide a search engine through the posts, pages, and categories to help the search engine crawl your site and gather the information it needs to include your site within its database.\nWordPress comes with several built in search optimization tools, including the ability to use .htaccess to create apparently static URLs called permalinks, blogrolling, and pinging. There are also a number of third party plugins and hacks which can be used for search engine optimization (SEO).\nHowever, once you start using various WordPress Themes and customizing WordPress to meet your own needs, you may break some of those useful search engine friendly features. To maintain your WordPress site’s optimal friendliness towards search engine spiders and crawlers, here are a few tips:\nGood, Clean Code \nMake sure your site’s code validates. Errors in your code may prevent a search engine from moving through the site successfully.\nContent Talks \nSearch engines can’t “see” a site. They can only “read” a site. Looks do not talk to a search engine. What “talks” to a search engine are the words, the content, the material in your site that explains, shares, informs, educates, and babbles. Make sure you have quality word content for a search engine to examine and compare with all the parts and pieces to give you a good “score”.\nWrite Your Content with Searchers in Mind \nHow do you find information on the Internet? If you are writing something that you want to be “found” on the Internet, think about the words and phrases someone would use to find your information. Use them more than once as you write, but not in every sentence. Learn how search engines scan your content, evaluate it, and categorize it so you can help yourself get in good favor with search engines.\nContent First \nA search engine enters your site and, for the most part, ignores the styles and CSS. It just plows through the site gathering content and information. Most WordPress Themes are designed with the content as close to the top of the unstyled page as possible, keeping sidebars and footers towards the bottom. Few search engines scan more than the first third of the page before moving on. Make sure your Theme puts the content near the top.\nKeywords, Links, and Titles Meet Content \nSearch engines do not evaluate your site on how pretty it is, but they do evaluate the words and put them through a sifter, giving credit to certain words and combinations of words. Words found within your document are compared to words found within your links and titles. The more that match, the better your “score.”\nContent in Links and Images \nYour site may not have much text, mostly photographs and links, but you have places in which to add textual content. Search engines look for alt and title in link and image tags. While these have a bigger purpose of making your site more accessible, having good descriptions and words in these attributes helps provide more content for search engines to digest.\nLink Popularity \nIt is not how good your site is, it is how good the sites are that link to you. This still holds weight with search engine favoritism. It’s about who links to you. Blogrolls, pingbacks, and trackbacks are all built into WordPress. These help you link to other people, which gives them credit, but it also helps them link to you, connecting the “links.” The number of incoming links your site has that have been recognized by Google can be checked by typing link:www.yoursite.com into Google (other search engines have similar functions). Other ways to generate incoming links to your site include:\nAdd your site’s url to your signature on forum posts on other sites.Submit your site to directories (see below).Note: Leaving comments on blogs will not help with this, since all modern blogging tools use the rel=”nofollow” attribute. Don’t be a comment spammer.\nGood Navigation Links \nA search engine crawls through your site, moving from page to page. Good navigational links to the categories, archives, and various pages on your site will invite a search engine to move gracefully from one page to another, following the connecting links and visiting most of your site.\nGet the Blog Indexed in Google Search\nBefore getting to the details on how you can get Google to recognize you, we need to first understand these three terms:\nThe Googlebot: This is the software used to search that is used by Google to gather new information that has been uploaded online so that it can be fed on Google pages. Once information that you had uploaded is picked up by this software, then it can be found on Google pages.Crawling: This is the process where the above named software, Googlebot, roams from site to site detecting any new information to be uploaded on Google. This software works by going through new links that have been uploaded recently and which are generating a lot of traffic.Indexing: Once the information has been gathered by the Googlebot through the process called crawling, it is processed through another process called indexing. It is through this process that the quality of content is determined so that they can be placed appropriately on Google pages. The question now is, how exactly does Googlebot find this information? Firstly, it starts by siting the web pages that it had cited in the previous search. It then detects new pages associated with those old ones or just new ones all together. More details on the same would be found on Search Console help for those who are interested in the same. Any new information is cited with the help of sitemaps and links that lead to those articles.\nSearch Engine Site Submissions\nThere are many resources that will “help” you submit your site to search engines. Some are free, some for a fee. Or you can manually submit your site to search engines yourself. Whatever method you choose to use, once your site has been checked for errors and is ready to go, search engines will welcome your WordPress site.\nHere are some tips for successful site submissions:\nMake sure you have content for search engines to scan. In general, have more than 10 posts on your site to give the search engines something to examine and evaluate.Do not submit your site to the same search engine more than once a month or longer, depending upon their criteria, not your anxiousness to be listed.Have ready to type, or copy and paste, the title of the site, and the categories your site may belong to in a search engine directory.Have a list of your website’s various “addresses/URLs” ready. You can submit your root directory as well as specific categories and feeds to search engines, expanding your search engine coverage.Keep a list of the various search engines and directories you submit to so you do not accidentally resubmit too soon, and you can keep track of how they include you among their pages and results.\nDirectory Sites\nIt is also useful for traffic generation and search optimization purposes to submit your site to directories. Both comprehensive directory sites and those specific to the subject or localisation of your site can be used.\nSearch Engine Optimization Resources\nWhile WordPress comes ready for search engines, the following are more resources and information you may want to know about preparing and maintaining your site for search engines’ robots and crawlers.\nMeta Tags\nMeta Tags contain information that describes your site’s purpose, description, and keywords used within your site. The meta tags are stored within the head of your header.php template file. By default, they are not included in WordPress, but you can manually include them and the article on Meta Tags in WordPress takes you through the process of adding meta tags to your WordPress site.\nThe WordPress Custom Fields option can also be used to include keywords and descriptions for posts and Pages. There are also several WordPress Plugins that can also help you to add meta tags and keyword descriptions to your site found within the Official WordPress Plugin Directory.\nRobots.txt Optimization\nSearch Engines read a file at yourdomain.com/robots.txt to get information on what they should and shouldn’t check.\nAdding entries to robots.txt to help SEO is popular misconception. Google says you are welcome to use robots.txt to block parts of your site but these days prefers you don’t. Use page-level noindex tags instead, to tackle low-quality parts of your site. Since 2009, Google has been evermore vocal in its advice to avoid blocking JS & CSS files, and Google’s Search Quality Team has been evermore active in promoting a policy of transparency by webmasters, to help Google verify we’re not “cloaking” or linking to unsightly spam on blocked pages. Therefore the ideal robots file disallows nothing whatsoever, and may link to an XML Sitemap if an accurate one has been constructed (which itself is rare though!).\nWordPress by default only blocks a couple of JS files but is nearly compliant with Google’s guidance here.\nSee also:\nHow Google Crawls My SiteHow do I use a robots.txt file to control access to my site?WordPress Robots.txt example and explanation from YoastUsing robots.txt for SEORemoving duplicate search engine content using robots.txtwikipedia – Robots.txt\nFeed Submissions\nWordPress comes built-in with various feeds, allowing your site to be viewed by various feed readers. Many search engines are now accepting feed submissions, and there are many site which specialize in directories of feeds and feed services.\nTo submit your site’s feeds, you need to know the link to the various feeds your site provides. The article WordPress Feeds lists the various links of the feeds that come built into WordPress.\nFor information on customizing these links, see the article on Customizing Feeds.\nPermalinks\nPermalinks are enhancements to your existing URLs which can improve search engine optimization by presenting your post, page, and archive URLs as something like <nowiki>http://example.com/2003/05/23/my-cheese-sandwich/</nowiki> rather than <nowiki>http://example.com/index.php?p=423</nowiki>. See Using Permalinks for more information.\nAs search engines use links and the title as part of their information gathering, links to posts and articles within your site gain importance with Permalinks.\nSitemaps\nA sitemap or “site map” is a single page listing of all the posts on your website. It is intended for your visitors to get a good overview on what your site is about and to find a blog post quickly but it also has great benefits in the search engines as a good link is always pointing to all your blog posts. By having a link to your sitemap on all your sites pages both visitors and search engines will easily get to it and find all your posts.\nGoogle Sitemaps\nAs of June 2005, Google is now accepting sitemaps of your site as part of their website submissions. Google needs to have this sitemap formatted in a special way using XML. You can find more information about Google’s Sitemap Submissions from Google, and the discussion on the WordPress Forum about WordPress and Google Site maps.\nSome utilities have been created to help the WordPress user to create a Google site map of their site for submission to Google. For more information on these and Google sitemaps:\nInside Google Sitemaps (Official Google Blog)\nLink Relationships\nThere is some debate over whether listing the link relations actually effect search engine ranking however it is simple to implement.\nWorld Wide Web Consortium (W3C)\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/search-engine-optimization/", "title": "Search Engine Optimization – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "WordPress, straight out of the box, comes ready to embrace search engines.

Use Bulk Edit to disable multiple posts at once.\n\nIn the Posts_Screen, check the checkbox in the Table’s title to select all Posts in a given table.\nFrom Bulk Actions box, select Edit and click Apply.\nIn the Bulk Edit Screen, select Do not allow option from Comments box\nClick Update.\n\n\nAlternatively, you could run below MySQL query from the command line on a shell account or using phpMyAdmin, or through a wp-cli wp db query:\nUPDATE wp_posts SET comment_status = 'closed';\n\nIf your goal is to permanently remove comments, then follow the next steps. This is the example of Twenty Fifteen theme customization.\n\nCreate a Child Themes of Twenty Fifteen theme.\nCopy twentyfifteen_entry_meta() function from parent’s inc/template-tags.php to child theme’s functions.php.\nComment out the if block that contains comments-link.\n\nfunction twentyfifteen_entry_meta() {\n    if ( is_sticky() && is_home() && ! is_paged() ) {\n        :\n    }\n\n    // if ( ! is_single() && ! post_password_required() && ( comments_open() || get_comments_number() ) ) {\n    //  echo '';\n    //  /* translators: %s: post title */\n    //  comments_popup_link( sprintf( __( 'Leave a comment on %s', 'twentyfifteen' ), get_the_title() ) );\n    //  echo '';\n    // }\n}\n\nIt removes the number of comments or “Leave a comment” message from bottom of each post.\n\nNewly create comments.php under the Child Theme’s directory without any contents. It removes the comment area of exsiting posts.\nActivate the Child Teheme.\n\nHow do I disable trackbacks and pingbacks?\nFirst, uncheck Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new articles on the Settings > Discussion screen. This will only disable trackbacks and pingbacks on future posts.Next, to completely disable trackbacks and pingbacks, you will have to edit each past post and uncheck Allow trackbacks and pingbacks on this page from the Edit Post screen. Use Bulk Edit to disable multiple posts at once. See also above image.\n\nIn the Posts_Screen, check the checkbox in the Table’s title to select all Posts in a given table.\nFrom Bulk Actions box, select Edit and click Apply.\nIn the Bulk Edit Screen, select Do not allow option from Pings box.\nClick Update.\n\nAlternatively, you could run this MySQL query from the command line on a shell account or using phpMyAdmin, or through a wp-cli wp db query:\nUPDATE wp_posts SET ping_status = 'closed';\n\nHow do I change the site admin name?\nTo change your Admin Name, in the Administration Screens, choose the Users->Your Profile menu. Make your changes there. However, you are not able to change the username from within the Administration screen. In order to do this you must directly edit the MySQL database, however this is not recommended as your username is not often seen by other users.\nSee:\n\nUsers Your Profile Screen\n\nHow do I find the absolute path I need for uploading images?\n\nOpen the below page from your Browser\n\nhttp://(site URL)/wp-admin/options.php\n\nRefer upload_url_path option value.\nIf the value is blank, then the directory wp-content/upload is the default destination to save.\n\nWhich files do I change to alter the way my blog looks?\nSee:\n\nTheme Development Handbook\n\nHow do I upload images?\nSee:\n\nInserting Media into Posts and Pages\n\nCan I change the “Error establishing database connection” message to something more descriptive?\nJust simply create a file to reside at wp-content/db-error.php, and in that file put the message you want displayed to users when WordPress determines the database connection is not available. That file will be used in place of “Error establishing database connection” message. You could even use the db-error.php to redirect users elsewhere. Here’s an example for db-error.php:\n<?php\n<pre>echo '<h2> This site is currently experiencing a problem with the database server.</h2>  Press your browser Reload button to try again!';\n?>\n\nModifying\nCan I change the Smilies?\nSee:\n\nUsing Smilies\n\nHow do I edit files?\nSee:\n\nEditing Files\n\nWhat is The Loop?\nSee:\n\nThe Loop and The Loop in Action\n\nHow can I change the URL-structure for my posts?\nSee:\n\nUsing Permalinks\n\nHow can I change URL-structure for my posts on a Windows server?\nSee:\n\nUsing Permalinks Without mod rewrite\n\nHow do I use WordPress Template Tags to change what is displayed on the blog?\nSee:\n\nTemplate Tags\n\nHow do I get All links to open in a new window?\nPut this inside the  section of your Theme’s template header.php file:\n<base target=\"_blank\" />\nSee:\n\nUsing Themes\nW3 Schools base tag explanation\n\nHow can I add an image to my RSS feed?\nSee:\n\nAdd an image to your RSS 2.0 feed at wordlog.com\n\nIf I turn off comments, it says “Comments Off” on the weblog. so how do I remove that?\nDepending on your theme, some other message of similar intent may be displayed. The specifics of how to remove this message is theme dependent. You should be able to find the offending text in your theme’s comments.php file. If it’s displayed by a PHP function, comment out the function with slash-asterisks ‘/*‘ and ‘*/‘ (without quotes) on either end of the function:\n<?php /* _e( 'Comments are closed.' , 'twentytwelve' ); */ ?>\nIf it’s simply HTML, comment out the enclosing HTML tags by adding ‘&lt;!-- ‘ and ‘ --&gt;‘ (not including the quotes, note the space after the first and before the last comment symbols):\n<!-- <p class=\"nocomments\">Comments are closed.</p> -->\nIf you decide later to restore the message, you can simply remove the comment symbols.\nHow do I change what is shown when I password protect a post?\nHook the filters ‘the_title‘ and ‘the_password_form‘. Your filter function is passed exactly what the filter names imply. Use the str_replace() function to search out the offending text and replace it with your preference (or nothing).Note the ‘the_title‘ filter fires for every single title, not just password protected posts, so you need to use the existence of the post_password property to know whether to apply the string replace function or not.Some themes may also have additional locations where content needs to be canged. Next example works with Twenty Fifteen Theme.\nadd_filter('the_title', 'replace_protected', 10, 2);\nfunction replace_protected( $title, $id ) {\n    $post = get_post( $id );\n    if ( ! empty( $post->post_password ) ) {\n        $title = str_replace('Protected:', 'Hidden:', $title);\n    }\n    return $title;\n}\nadd_filter('the_password_form', 'replace_message');\nfunction replace_message( $form ) {\n    return str_replace('This post is password protected. To view it please enter your password below:',\n        'Enter you password below to see the surprise:', $form);\n}\n\nHow can I allow certain HTML tags in my comments?\nUse a custom filter in your themes functions.php or plugin:\nadd_filter('preprocess_comment','fa_allow_tags_in_comments');\n\nfunction fa_allow_tags_in_comments($data) {\n    global $allowedtags;\n    $allowedtags['span'] = array('style'=>array());\n    $allowedtags['p'] = array();\n    return $data;\n}\n\nHow can I add advanced search ability to WordPress?\nSee:\n\nAdvanced Contextual Search for WordPress at Weblog Tools Collection\n\nPosts\nHow do I upload an image and display it in a post?\nSee:\n\nInserting Media into Posts and Pages\n\nWhat is pingback?\nSee:\n\nIntroduction to Blogging, Pingbacks\n\nWhat is trackback?\nSee:\n\nIntroduction to Blogging, Trackbacks\n\nWhere is the permalink to my post?\nSee:\n\nLinking Posts, Pages, and Categories\n\nCan I use desktop blogging software?\nSee:\n\nWeblog Client\n\nCan I blog by email?\nSee:\n\nPost to your blog using email\n\nSpam, Spammers, Comments\nWhat can I do to stop comment spam?\nSee:\n\nCombating Comment Spam\n\nMore Information on Comment Spam\nSee:\n\nComment Spam\n\nImporting and Exporting\nHow do I Import a WordPress WXR file when it says it is too large to import?\nIf a WordPress WXR file, an XML file exported from WordPress, is too large to import, there are several things you might try to overcome that limit.\n\nEdit php.ini‘. Some hosts may not allow this settings.\n\nmemory_limit = 300M\npost_max_size = 200M\nupload_max_filesize = 100M\nmax_execution_time = 600\n\n\nmemory_limit: Maximum amount of memory in bytes that a PHP script is allowed to allocate.\n\nNote: memory_limit should be larger than post_max_size, and post_max_size must be larger than upload_max_filesize.\n\nEdit .htaccess. Some hosts may not allow this settings.\n\nphp_value memory_limit 300M\nphp_value post_max_size 200M\nphp_value upload_max_filesize 100M\n\n\nEdit wp-config.php\n\ndefine('WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '64MB');\n\nSee also Increasing memory allocated to PHP.\n\nIn multisite environment, configure following settings\n\nFrom Network Admin dashboard, select Settings > Network Settings and increase the values of ‘Site upload space’ and ‘Max upload file size’.\nFrom Network Admin dashboard, select Sites > All Sites and click Edit menu under your site. Click Settings tab and incease the value of ‘Site Upload Space Quota’ or leave it blank for network default\n\n\nGZip the file. On some hosting services, a gzipped file can be automatically expanded in the background, without WordPress ever knowing the difference. This can allow you to make the file small enough to be fit into the maximum upload size constraints.\n\nOn Windows, use 7Zip to create a gz archive out of the WXR file.\nOn Linux, use the gzip command line.\nMake sure that the resulting file has the file extension of “.gz” before uploading it, as this is often necessary.\nThis is not guaranteed to work, as it highly depends on the hosting configuration. If this fails, then try another method instead.\n\n\nBreak the WordPress WXR file into smaller pieces by separating the data between posts and pasting the header/footer into each file.\n\n1. Always have the header\n<rss version=\"2.0\"\n    xmlns:excerpt=\"https://wordpress.org/export/1.2/excerpt/\"\n    xmlns:content=\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\"\n    xmlns:wfw=\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\"\n    xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"\n    xmlns:wp=\"https://wordpress.org/export/1.2/\"\n>\n<channel>\nincluding all info like category, tags, etc to just before the first\n\n2. Always have the footer\n</channel>\n</rss>\n\n3. In between, add the posts start with end with and check to see whether the XML file you’re creating is less than or equal to 2MB. You’ll get the hang of it.\n4. As always, before importing the new XML’s, backup the database of the blog you are importing the XML files to and might as well export XML file of that blog as well for good measure.\nSee:\n\nImporting Content\n\nEditing wp-config.php\nForum discussion on program that helps with splitting the file into pieces\n\n\n\nWXR Splitter Utilities:\n\nWordPress WXR File Splitter utility for Windows\nWordPress WXR File Splitter utility for Mac OS X\n\nHow do I import links (blogroll) from another WordPress blog?\nSee:\nImporting Content\nCodex FAQ\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-work-with-wordpress/", "title": "FAQ Work with WordPress – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Administration Can my posts have URL instead of /index.php?p=76?

{"text": "\nCustomizing the Time and Date Format\nCertain WordPress tag functions are used to display or return date and time information; the_date() and the_time() are examples of this.\nBy default, these functions will display or return date and time in format as it is set in Administration > Settings > General. This is the place where customizing format for Date and Time will take effect throughout the whole WordPress installation.\nFormatting Date and Time\nNotice the string of characters next to each Date and Time formatting in screenshot. This string is called a format string. Each letter represents specific part of Date or Time.\nFor example, the format string:\nl, F j, Y\ncreates a date that look like this (note that commas are read literally):\nFriday, September 24, 2004\nHere is what each format character in the string above represents:\nl = Full name for day of the week (lower-case L).F = Full name for the month.j = The day of the month.Y = The year in 4 digits. (lower-case y gives the year’s last 2 digits)\nFormat characters are standardized and globally used in PHP programming language. As WordPress is written in PHP programming language you can use the table of Date and Time format characters directly from the PHP website.\nHere is a table of some of the more useful items found there:\n\n\n\nDay of Month\n\n\nd\nNumeric, with leading zeros\n01–31\n\n\nj\nNumeric, without leading zeros\n1–31\n\n\nS\nThe English suffix for the day of the month\nst, nd or th in the 1st, 2nd or 15th.\n\n\nWeekday\n\n\nl\nFull name  (lowercase ‘L’)\nSunday – Saturday\n\n\nD\nThree letter name\nMon – Sun\n\n\nMonth\n\n\nm\nNumeric, with leading zeros\n01–12\n\n\nn\nNumeric, without leading zeros\n1–12\n\n\nF\nTextual full\nJanuary – December\n\n\nM\nTextual three letters\nJan – Dec\n\n\nYear\n\n\nY\nNumeric, 4 digits\nEg., 1999, 2003\n\n\ny\nNumeric, 2 digits\nEg., 99, 03\n\n\nTime\n\n\na\nLowercase\nam, pm\n\n\nA\nUppercase\nAM, PM\n\n\ng\nHour, 12-hour, without leading zeros\n1–12\n\n\nh\nHour, 12-hour, with leading zeros\n01–12\n\n\nG\nHour, 24-hour, without leading zeros\n0-23\n\n\nH\nHour, 24-hour, with leading zeros\n00-23\n\n\ni\nMinutes, with leading zeros\n00-59\n\n\ns\nSeconds, with leading zeros\n00-59\n\n\nT\nTimezone abbreviation\nEg., EST, MDT …\n\n\nFull Date/Time\n\n\nc\nISO 8601\n2004-02-12T15:19:21+00:00\n\n\nr\nRFC 2822\nThu, 21 Dec 2000 16:01:07 +0200\n\n\nU\nUnix timestamp (seconds since Unix Epoch)\n1455880176\n\n\n\nFormat String Examples\nHere are some examples of date format with the result output.\nF j, Y g:i a – November 6, 2010 12:50 amF j, Y – November 6, 2010F, Y – November, 2010g:i a – 12:50 amg:i:s a – 12:50:48 aml, F jS, Y – Saturday, November 6th, 2010M j, Y @ G:i – Nov 6, 2010 @ 0:50Y/m/d \\a\\t g:i A – 2010/11/06 at 12:50 AMY/m/d \\a\\t g:ia – 2010/11/06 at 12:50amY/m/d g:i:s A – 2010/11/06 12:50:48 AMY/m/d – 2010/11/06\nOverriding General Settings Formatting\nFunctions for Time and Date accept format string as a parameter in order to override default Date and Time formatting for certain places in theme or plugin files. Just the same as in General Settings, this format string is a template of characters where each character represents specific part of Date or Time.\nInside the template file, setting the Date and Time format string as a parameter for the_time() template tag, would look something like this:\nPosted on <?php the_time( 'l, F jS, Y' ); ?>.\nWhich will render on the frontend of your site as following:\nPosted on Friday, September 24th, 2004.\nLocalization\nTo localize Date and Time, use the wp_date() function. The wp_date() function basically behaves like the PHP date() function, except that it also translates things like month names and weekdays and similar into the current locale for the site. You can replace a call to date() with a call to wp_date(), using the same arguments.\n$date = wp_date( 'F j, Y' );\n$time = wp_date( 'g:i a' );\nAlternatively, you can wrap your predefined format in __() or _e() in order to allow translators to adjust the Date and Time to the proper local format. If you do so, then you should also include a translator comment, to let the translators know what the date format is referring to and where it is used, so they can convert it accurately.\n__( 'Y/m/d g:i:s a', 'textdomain' );\nEscaping\nSome letters do not have an associated format in the PHP date function. For example x passed in the format string will currently return a literal x. However, this can change at some point in the future and x may have a format associated with it.\nThis is why you should always escape literal character in a date formatted string with \\. Note that, in following example, every letter of word of is escaped.\nwp_date( __( 'l jS \\o\\f F Y', 'textdomain' ) );\nThis example will render as following on the frontend of your site:\nSaturday 25th of February 2017\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/customize-date-and-time-format/", "title": "Customize date and time format – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Customizing the Time and Date Format Certain WordPress tag functions are used to display or return date and time information; the_date() and the_time() are examples of this.

A handy in-line edit tool, called Quick Edit, allows you to update many fields for an individual Post. Various search and filtering options allow you to find the Posts you want to edit or delete.\nAdd New Post\nPosts Add New Screen is where you write new Posts. While you are writing those Posts, you can also create new Categories and new Tags. In addition, any Media (pictures, video, recordings, files) can be uploaded and inserted into the Posts.\nCategories\nEvery Post in WordPress is filed under one or more Categories. Categories allow the classification of your Posts into groups and subgroups, thereby aiding viewers in the navigation and use of your site.\nEach Category may be assigned to a Category Parent so that you may set up a hierarchy within the category structure. Using automobiles as an example, a hierarchy might be Car->Ford->Mustang. In creating categories, recognize that each category name must be unique, regardless of hierarchy.\nWhen using the WordPress default theme, all the Categories to which a given post belongs are displayed under that post. When someone viewing your blog clicks on one of those Category links, a archive page with all the Posts belonging to that Category will be displayed.\nThe Posts Categories Screen allows you to add, edit, and delete Categories, as well as organize your categories hierarchically. Multiple Categories can be selected for deletion. A search option allows you to find the Categories you want to edit or delete. Also remember Categories can be added in the Posts Add New Screen.\nTags\nTags are the keywords you might assign to each post. Not to be confused with Categories, Tags have no hierarchy, meaning there’s no relationship from one Tag to another. But like Categories, Tags provide another means to aid your readers in accessing information on your blog.\nWhen using the WordPress default theme, Tags are displayed under each Post those Tags are assigned. Someone viewing your blog can click on one of those Tag links, and an archive page with all the Posts belonging to that Tag will be displayed.\nThe Posts Tags Screen allows you to add, change, or delete Tags. Multiple Tags can be selected for deletion. A search option allows you to find the Tags you want to edit or delete. Also remember Tags can be added in the Posts Add New Screen.\nMedia – Add pictures and movies to your posts\nMedia is the images, video, recordings, and files, you upload and use in your blog. Media is typically uploaded and inserted into the content when writing a Post or Page. Note that the Uploading Files section in the Settings Media Screen describes the location and structure of the upload directory.\nLibrary\nThe Media Library Screen allows you add, edit, delete or view Media previously uploaded to your blog. Multiple Media objects can be selected for deletion. Search and filtering ability is also provided to allow you to find the desired Media.\nAdd New Media\nThe Media Add New Screen allows you to upload new media to later use with posts and pages. A drag and drop Uploader is provided and the ability to use a Browser Uploader button is also supplied.\nEdit Media\nThe Edit Media page allows you to edit the information (title, caption, alt text, etc.) of media files uploaded to your site. This page does not appear as a link in the main Dashboard navigation, but is reached by clicking on the Edit link in the Media Library Screen that appears when you hover over each item, or when uploading media for the first time on the Media Add New Screen once your upload has completed.\nPages – Your Static Content\nA Page is another tool to add content to a WordPress site and is often used to present “static” information about the site; Pages are typically “timeless” in nature. A good example of a Page is the information contained in “About” or “Contact” Pages. A Page should not be confused with the time-oriented objects called Posts, nor should a WordPress Page be confused with the word “page” referring to any web page or HTML document on the Web.\nBecause Pages live outside of the normal blog chronology, and as such, are not displayed with the rest of your Posts, but are displayed individually.\nAll Pages\nThe All Pages Screen provides the necessary tools to edit, delete or view existing Pages. On this Screen you can select the Page to edit, delete or view. Multiple Pages can be selected for deletion and for editing. A powerful bulk edit tool allows certain fields to be edited for a whole group of Pages. A handy in-line edit tool, called Quick Edit, allows you to update many fields for an individual Page. Various search and filtering options allow you to find the Pages you want to edit or delete.\nAdd New Page\nThe Add New Page Screen allows you to create new Pages. Also see the Pages article for an in depth discussion.\nComments – Reader Feedback\nComments are a feature of blogs which allow readers to respond to Posts.\nIn the Comments Screen you can edit and delete as well as mark comments as spam. Comments that are awaiting moderation can be marked as approved or previously approved comments can be unapproved. Multiple comments can be selected and approved, marked as spam, unapproved, or deleted. A section at the top of the Comments Screen displays the number of comments awaiting moderation and the number of approved comments. A search box allows you to find specific comments\nAppearance – Change the Look of your Blog\nWordPress allows you to easily style your site by either installing and activating new Themes or customizing existing Themes.\nTips: From Theme Customizer launched by Appearance > Customize, you can customize all other options such as Theme, Widgets, Menus and Header. Also, modern theme has other settings or options. You should try Theme Customizer \nThemes\nA Theme is the overall design of a site and encompasses color, graphics, and text. WordPress site-owners have available a long list of Themes to choose from in deciding what to present to their sites’ viewers.\nFrom the Appearance Themes Screen, you can choose which Theme will be presented to users visiting your site. You can also view screenshots of each Theme you have uploaded to your site. In addition, under the Install Themes tab you can find and install new Themes.\nCustomize\nThe Customize Screen displays the settings that can be customized for a specific theme. For instance, the WordPress default theme provides options that allows the user to set the colors and a background image.\nThe Customize Screen page describes the details of this feature.\nWidgets\nWidgets are gadgets or gizmos that allow you to add various pieces of information to your Theme’s sidebar content. Widgets, for example, can be used to add Categories, Archives, Blogroll, Recent Posts, and Recent Comments to your sidebar.\nFrom the Appearance Widgets Screen you can add, delete, and configure, the Widgets use in one or more of your Theme’s sidebar.\nMenus\nThe Menus feature allows you to create a navigation menu of pages, categories, custom links, tags, etc. that is presented to your visitors. A custom menu WordPress Widget allows display of a custom menu in the sidebar or other widgetized areas in the Theme.\nFrom the Appearance Menus Screen you can create and edit navigation menus for visitors use.\nHeader\nThe Header feature allows you to manage what image is displayed in a Theme’s header. WordPress default theme allows you to preview, upload, remove, and set as default, the images you want randomly displayed in the header.\nThe Appearance Header Screen describes the details of this feature.\nPlugins – Add Functionality to your Blog\nPlugins allow you to add new features to your WordPress blog that don’t come standard with the default installation. There are a rich variety of Available Plugins for WordPress, and with the following Screens, plugin installation and management is a snap.\nInstalled Plugins\nThe Plugins Installed Screen allows you to view the plugins you’ve downloaded and choose which plugins you want activated on your site. For information on downloading and installing plugins, see Managing Plugins.\nAdd New Plugins\nThe Plugins Add New Screen allows you to add new plugins. For information on downloading and installing plugins, see Managing Plugins.\nPlugin File Editor\nUsing the Plugin File Editor Screen, you can modify the source code of all your plugins. \nUsers – Your Blogging Family\nEvery blog probably has at least two users: admin, the account initially set up by WordPress, and the user account you, as the author/owner of the blog, use to write posts. If you want a person to be able to post to your blog, that person must have access to a user account; typically, every person will have her or his own user account.\nVia the Users option in the main navigation menu you can set up all of the user accounts you need, as well as change user information, or delete users. Also you can specify your, and others’, personal information, such as name, e-mail, etc. from these User Administration Screens.\nAll Users\nYou can manage the accounts of all your site’s users at the All Users Screen.\nAdd New User\nYou can create new users with the Users Add New Screen.\nYour Profile\nThe Users Your Profile Screen allows to change any information related to your user account.\nTools – Managing your Blog\nWordPress Tools provide you the ability to speed up WordPress for your local machine, import content from other sources, export your content, or to upgrade your WordPress software to a new release.\nAvailable Tools\nThere is a link to the Categories and Tag Converter. The Available Tools Screen describes the function.\nImport\nWordPress supports the importing data from a number external sources. In many cases, posts, comments, pages, categories, tags, and users, can be imported.\nThe Importing Content for a more extensive list of import possibilites.\nExport\nWordPress Export will create an XML file for you to save to your computer. The format, which is called a WordPress eXtended RSS or WXR file, will contain your posts, comments, custom fields, categories, and tags.\nThe Tools Export Screen guides you through the easy process of exporting your blog. Take note that the Exporting is a useful method to backup your WordPress data.\nSite Health\nThe Site Health Screen offers a diagnosis of your site’s health. It gives you actionable information on how to improve your WordPress site in the form of critical errors and warnings. It also gives you a summary of the technical aspects of your site.\nThere are two tabs on the site health page:\n1. Status – The status tab allows you to see critical information about your WordPress configuration, along with anything else that requires your attention.\n2. Info – The info tab is a granular view of the technical aspects of your WordPress website. You can see detailed information about every aspect of your site such as themes, plugins, and media.  There is also a useful export feature that allows you to copy all of the information about your site to the clipboard.Settings – Configuration Settings \nGeneral\nIn the Settings Administration Screen are all of the settings that define your blog as a whole: settings which determine how your site behaves, how you interact with your site, and how the rest of the world interacts with your site.\nThe Settings Administration Screen and controls some of the most basic configuration settings for your site: your site’s title and location, who may register an account at your blog, and how dates and times are calculated and displayed.\nWriting\nUsing the Settings Writing Screen, you can control the interface with which you write new posts. These settings control the default Category, the default Post Format, and the optional feature.\nReading\nThe settings in the posts, or a “static” Page, displayed as your blog’s front (main) page. You can also adjust how many posts are displayed on that main page. In addition, you can adjust syndication feed features to determine how the information from your site is sent to a reader’s web browser or other applications.\nDiscussion\nThe Settings Discussion Screen allows you to control settings concerning incoming and outgoing comments, pingbacks and trackbacks. You can also control from this Screen the circumstances under which your blog sends you e-mail notifying you about the goings on at your site, and you can decide if your blog should show Avatars and their ratings.\nMedia\nThe Settings Media Screen allows you to determine how images, documents, and other media files will be organized when uploaded, and to specify the maximum dimensions in pixels to use when inserting an image into the body of a post.\nPermalinks\nFor a nice introduction to Permalinks, check out the Pretty Permalinks section of Introduction to Blogging. By default, WordPress uses web URLs which have question marks and lots of numbers in them; however, WordPress offers you the ability to create a custom URL structure for your permalinks and archives. This can improve the aesthetics, usability, and forward-compatibility of your links.\nThe Settings Permalinks Screen controls how that custom URL structure is defined.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administration-screens/", "title": "Administration Screens – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "The Administration Screen provides access to the control features of your WordPress installation.

One of two methods are available to deactivate all plugins.\nUse phpMyAdmin to deactivate all plugins.\nIn the table wp_options, under the option_name column (field) find the active_plugins rowChange the option_value field to: a:0:{}\nOr reset your plugins folder via FTP or the file manager provided in your host’s control panel. This method preserves plugin options but requires plugins be manually reactivated.\nVia FTP or your host’s file manager, navigate to the wp-contents folder (directory)Via FTP or your host’s file manager, rename the folder “plugins” to “plugins.hold”Login to your WordPress administration plugins page (/wp-admin/plugins.php) – this will disable any plugin that is “missing”.Via FTP or your host’s file manager, rename “plugins.hold” back to “plugins”\nHow to clear the “Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance” message after doing automatic upgrade?\nAs part of the automatic upgrade WordPress places a file named .maintenance in the blog base folder (folder that contains the wp-admin folder). If that file exists, then vistors will see the message Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. Check back in a minute.\nTo stop that message from being displayed to vistors, just delete the .maintenance file. The automatic upgrade should be executed again, just in case it failed.\nAn update was just released, so why does my blog not recognize the update is available?\nWhen an update is released, notification of that release is displayed at the top administration screens saying WordPress x.x.x is available! Please update now. Not every blog will see that message at the same time. Your blog is programmed to check for updates every 12 hours, but the timing of that check is purely random. So if your blog just checked for updates minutes before an update was released, you won’t see the update message until your blog checks for updates 12 hours later.\nIf you want your blog to check right now for updates, you can delete the update_core option name record in your wp_options table. Note that plugins and themes each have their own check and update cycle, controlled by the records update_plugins and update_themes, in wp_options.\nRelevant discussion thread:\nhttps://wordpress.org/support/topic/242485\nWhy did I lose custom changes to the WordPress Default Theme during the last automatic upgrade?\nA core upgrade copies all the new files from the distribution over the old ones, so if you changed existing files in the WordPress default theme (e.g. wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/style.css), those changes got overwritten with the new version of that file.\nPlease note, a core upgrade goes through a list of “old files”, as defined in wp-admin/includes/update-core.php, and deletes those files. Any files not on the list, and not in the distribution, are preserved.\nRemember, that before upgrades, whether automatic or manual, both the WordPress Files and database should be backed-up as explained in WordPress Backups.\nA better way to modify the default theme is by using a child theme. It’s a little more work to set up, but worth the effort because your customizations will be safe when the main theme is updated.\nHow do you repair a MySQL database table?\nEvery once in a while, it may be necessary to repair one or more MySQL database tables. According to the How to Repair MyISAM Tables at dev.mysql.com there are a number of reasons to repair a table including errors such as “tbl_name.frm is locked against change”, “Can’t find file tbl_name.MYI (Errcode: nnn)”, “Unexpected end of file”, “Record file is crashed”, or “Got error nnn from table handler”.\nHere are the steps to repair a table in a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin:\nLogin to hosting account.Login to phpMyAdmin.Choose the affected database. If you only have one database, it should choose it by default so you don’t need to do anything.In the main panel, you should see a list of your database tables. Check the boxes by the tables that need repair.At the bottom of the window just below the list of tables, there is a drop down menu. Choose “Repair Table”\nRemember, that it is advisable to have a current backup of your database at all times. See also WordPress Backups\nHow do I empty a database table?\nRefer Emptying a Database Table\nEmailed passwords are not being received\nDescription: When users try to register with your blog or change their passwords by entering their username and/or email, WordPress indicates that their password has been emailed to them, but it is never received.\nReason and Solutions: WordPress uses the standard PHP mail() function, which uses sendmail. No account information is needed. This is not generally a problem if you are using a hosting service, but if you are using your own box and do not have an SMTP server, the mail will never send. If you are using a *NIX box, you should have either postfix or sendmail on your machine; you will just need to set them up (search the Internet for how-to’s). If you do not want to go through setting up a complete mail server on your *NIX box you may find msmtp useful — it provides “A secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your mail hub”. On a Windows machine, try a sendmail emulator like Glob SendMail.\nMore help can be found on this thread of the WordPress Support Forums: https://wordpress.org/support/topic.php?id=24981.\nWindows Host Server Specific: Check your “Relay” settings on the SMTP Virtual Server. Grant access to 127.0.0.1 . Then in your php.inifile, set the SMTP setting to the same IP address. Also set smtp_port to 25.\nEnsure Proper Return Address is Used: By default, the WordPress mailer fills in the From: field with wordpress@yourdomain.com and the From: name as WordPress.\nThis is fine if this is a valid e-mail address. For example, if your real e-mail is wordpress@yourdomain.com, your host should pass the email on for delivery. It will probably send your mail as long as yourdomain.com is setup to send and receive mail, even if wordpress is not a valid mail box. But if you set you real email as the From: address and it’s something like wpgod@gmail.com, the mail may not send because gmail.com is not a domain handled by the mail server.\nTreated as Spam: Your email message may have been routed to a spam folder or even worse, simply discarded as malicious. There are a couple measures you can use to convince recipient’s mail servers that your message is legitimate and should be delivered as addressed.\nSPF: (Sender Policy Framework) This is the most common anti-spam measure used. If you are on a hosted system, there is a good chance your host has set this up for the mail server you are using. Have WordPress email you and check the message headers for evidence that the message passed the SPF check. You can get a message sent by following the Forgot Password link on the login page. To keep your old password, do not follow the link in the message.If your system email failed the SPF check, you can set up the credentials if you have access to your DNS records and your mail server’s domain belongs to you. Check the return path of the email your system sent. If the mail server listed there has your domain name, you can set up SPF credentials. There are several how-tos on the Internet.\nDKIM: (Domain Key Identified Mail) This system is also used. You can use both SPF and DKIM in the same message. Again, just as with SPF, you can check if your receiving mailserver verified your host’s domain key by examining the mail header. There is a fair chance no signature key was provided, indicating your host chose to not use this protocol. Also as with SPF, if you can edit your DNS records and the mail server belongs to your domain, you can set up DKIM credentials yourself. Some how-tos exist if you search the Internet.\nWhy can’t I see my posts? All I see is Sorry, no posts match your criteria?\nClearing your browser cache and cookies may resolve this problem. See also I Make Changes and Nothing Happens\nHow do I solve the Headers already sent warning problem?\nDescription: You got a warning message on your browser that says:\nWarning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by\n(output started at\nReason and Solution:\nIt is usually because there are spaces, new lines, or other stuff before an opening <?php tag or after a closing ?> tag, typically in wp-config.php. This can also happen in other edited PHP files that are not theme templates, so please check the error message, as it will list the specific file name where the error occurred (see “Interpreting the Error Message” below). Replacing the faulty file with one from your most recent backup or one from a fresh WordPress download is your best bet, but if neither of those are an option, please follow the steps below.\nJust because you cannot see anything does not mean that PHP sees the same.\nDownload the file mentioned in the error message via FTP or the file manager provided in your host’s control panel.Open that file in a plain text editor (NOT Microsoft Word or similar. Notepad or BBEdit are fine).Check that the very first characters are  with no blank lines or spaces after it.Before saving, or use the Save as dialog, ensure the file encoding is not UTF-8 BOM but plain UTF-8 or any without the BOM suffix.\nTo be sure about the end of the file, do this:\nPlace the cursor between the ? and >Now press the DELETE key on your computer\nNote to MAC users: The “DELETE” key on a PC deletes characters to the right of the cursor. That is the key noted here.Keep that key pressedFor at least 15 secondsNow type > andsave without pressing any other key at all.If you press another key, you will bring the problem back.DO NOT PUT CODE IN UNNECESSARY CODE BLOCKS, PUT THEM IN A SINGLE PHP BLOCK.\nWrong:\n<?php some code; ?> <?php some other codes; ?> \nCorrect:\n<?php code; some other code; ?> \nUpload the file back to your server after editing and saving the file.\nNote: Also check the encoding of the file. If the file is encoded as UTF-8 with BOM, the BOM is seen as a character which starts the output.\nInterpreting the Error Message:\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/blog/wp-config.php:34) in /path/blog/wp-login.php on line 42, then the problem is at line #34 of wp-config.php, not line #42 of wp-login.php. In this scenario, line #42 of wp-login.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #34 of wp-config.php.\nIf the error message states: Warning: Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at /path/wp-admin/admin-header.php:8) in /path/wp-admin/post.php on line 569, then the problem is at line #8 of admin-header.php, not line #569 of post.php. In this scenario, line #569 of post.php is the victim. It is being affected by the excess whitespace at line #8 of admin-header.php.\nWhy doesn’t my “Publish” or “Save Draft” button work?\nTo resolve this and similar issues, disable your plugins one at a time until you find the source of the issue. Generally, this will be due to two or more plugins trying to use the same resources (for example, JQuery or other Java-based tools).\nIn addition, it could be that there is a problem with your browser. A common resolution is to empty the browser’s cache. Please consult the documentation for your preferred browser to learn how to do this.\nHow to fix 404 error when using Pretty Permalinks?\nIf an error 404 occurs when using the Pretty Permalink choices such as Day and Name in Administration > Settings > Settings_Permalinks_Screen it could be a result of the mod_rewrite module not being activated/installed. The solution is to activate mod_rewrite for the Apache web-server. Check the apache\\conf\\httpd.conf file for the line # LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.soand delete the # in front of the line. Then stop Apache and start it again. Note: you may have to ask your host to activate mod_rewrite.\nSee also Using Permalinks. Relevant discussion thread is https://wordpress.org/support/topic/234726\nWhy isn’t the admin user listed as an author when editing posts?\nNot sure why this problem happens, but here’s a couple of things to try one of these two solutions.\nThis usually fixes the problem:\nCreate new admin user (e.g. newadmin) with Administrator RoleLogin as ‘newadmin’Degrade the old ‘admin’ user to Role of Subscriber and SavePromote the old ‘admin’ back to Administrator Role and SaveLogin as the old ‘admin’\nIf that doesn’t work, try:\nCreate a new admin user (e.g. newadmin) with Administrator RoleLogin as ‘newadmin’Delete the old ‘admin’ user and assign any posts to ‘newadmin’Create ‘admin’ user with Administrator RoleLogin as ‘admin’Delete ‘newadmin’ user and assign posts to ‘admin’\nWhy is the wrong author name displayed for a post on a blog?\nThis problem is usually solved by the same solution as is presented in the question right before this one:Why isn’t the admin user listed as an author when editing posts?\nHow do I find more help?\nThere are various resources that will help you find more help with WordPress, in addition to these FAQ.\nTroubleshootingFinding WordPress HelpUsing the Support ForumsResources and Technical Articles about WordPressInstallation Problems\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-troubleshooting/", "title": "FAQ Troubleshooting – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Also refer Common WordPress Errors for the most common WordPress errors experienced by WordPress users such as The White ScreenInternal Server ErrorError Establishing Database ConnectionFailed Auto-UpgradeConnection Timed OutMaintenance Mode Following UpgradePHP errors or MySQL DB errors How to deactivate all plugins when not able to access the administrative menus?

{"text": "\nOn computer file systems, different files and directories have permissions that specify who and what can read, write, modify and access them.

It cannot cover all cases. This guide applies to servers running a standard setup (note, for shared hosting using “suexec” methods, see below).\nTypically, all files should be owned by your user (ftp) account on your web server, and should be writable by that account. On shared hosts, files should never be owned by the webserver process itself (sometimes this is www, or apache, or nobody user).\nAny file that needs write access from WordPress should be owned or group-owned by the user account used by WordPress (which may be different than the server account). For example, you may have a user account that lets you FTP files back and forth to your server, but your server itself may run using a separate user, in a separate usergroup, such as dhapache or nobody. If WordPress is running as the FTP account, that account needs to have write access, i.e., be the owner of the files, or belong to a group that has write access. In the latter case, that would mean permissions are set more permissively than default (for example, 775 rather than 755 for folders, and 664 instead of 644).\nThe file and folder permissions of WordPress should be the same for most users, depending on the type of installation you performed and the umask settings of your system environment at the time of install.\nNOTE: If an experienced user installed WordPress for you, you likely do not need to modify file permissions. Unless you are experiencing problems with permission errors, or you want to, you probably should not mess with this.\nNOTE: If you installed WordPress yourself, you likely DO need to modify file permissions. Some files and directories should be “hardened” with stricter permissions, specifically, the wp-config.php file. This file is initially created with 644 permissions, and it’s a hazard to leave it like that. See Security and Hardening.\nTypically, all core WordPress files should be writable only by your user account (or the httpd account, if different). (Sometimes though, multiple ftp accounts are used to manage an install, and if all ftp users are known and trusted, i.e., not a shared host, then assigning group writable may be appropriate. Ask your server admin for more info.) However, if you utilize mod_rewrite Permalinks or other .htaccess features you should make sure that WordPress can also write to your /.htaccess file.\nIf you want to use the built-in theme editor, all files need to be group writable. Try using it before modifying file permissions, it should work. (This may be true if different users uploaded the WordPress package and the Plugin or Theme. This wouldn’t be a problem for Plugin and Themes installed via the admin. When uploading files with different ftp users group writable is needed. On shared hosting, make sure the group is exclusive to users you trust… the apache user shouldn’t be in the group and shouldn’t own files.)\nSome plugins require the /wp-content/ folder be made writeable, but in such cases they will let you know during installation. In some cases, this may require assigning 755 permissions. The same is true for /wp-content/cache/ and maybe /wp-content/uploads/ (if you’re using MultiSite you may also need to do this for /wp-content/blogs.dir/)\nAdditional directories under /wp-content/ should be documented by whatever plugin / theme requires them. Permissions will vary.\n/\n|- index.php\n|- wp-admin\n|   `- wp-admin.css\n|- wp-blog-header.php\n|- wp-comments-post.php\n|- wp-commentsrss2.php\n|- wp-config.php\n|- wp-content\n|   |- cache\n|   |- plugins\n|   |- themes\n|   `- uploads\n|- wp-cron.php\n|- wp-includes\n`- xmlrpc.php\n\nShared Hosting with suexec\nThe above may not apply to shared hosting systems that use the “suexec” approach for running PHP binaries. This is a popular approach used by many web hosts. For these systems, the php process runs as the owner of the php files themselves, allowing for a simpler configuration and a more secure environment for the specific case of shared hosting.\nNote: suexec methods should NEVER be used on a single-site server configuration, they are more secure only for the specific case of shared hosting.\nIn such an suexec configuration, the correct permissions scheme is simple to understand.\nAll files should be owned by the actual user’s account, not the user account used for the httpd process.Group ownership is irrelevant, unless there’s specific group requirements for the web-server process permissions checking. This is not usually the case.All directories should be 755 or 750.All files should be 644 or 640. Exception: wp-config.php should be 440 or 400 to prevent other users on the server from reading it.No directories should ever be given 777, even upload directories. Since the php process is running as the owner of the files, it gets the owners permissions and can write to even a 755 directory.\nIn this specific type setup, WordPress will detect that it can directly create files with the proper ownership, and so it will not ask for FTP credentials when upgrading or installing plugins.\nPopular methods used by sysadmins for this setup are:\nsuPHP, runs through php-cgi, currently unmaintained since 2013.mod_ruid2, apache module, currently unmaintained since 2013.mpm-itk, apache module.mod_fcgid, an Apache module and FastCGI server with more extensive configuration.PHP-FPM, an alternative FastCGI server with shared OPCode, for use with Apache and Nginx.\nUsing an FTP Client\nFTP programs (“clients”) allow you to set permissions for files and directories on your remote host. This function is often called chmod or set permissions in the program menu.\nIn WordPress install, two files that you will probably want to alter are the index page, and the css which controls the layout. Here’s how you change index.php – the process is the same for any file.\nIn the screenshot below, look at the last column – that shows the permissions. It looks a bit confusing, but for now just note the sequence of letters. \nInitial permissions\nRight-click ‘index.php’ and select ‘File Permissions’A popup screen will appear.\nAltering file permissions\nDon’t worry about the check boxes. Just delete the ‘Numeric value:’ and enter the number you need – in this case it’s 666. Then click OK. \nPermissions have been altered.\nYou can now see that the file permissions have been changed.\nUnhide the hidden files\nBy default, most FTP Clients, including FileZilla, keep hidden files, those files beginning with a period (.), from being displayed. But, at some point, you may need to see your hidden files so that you can change the permissions on that file. For example, you may need to make your .htaccess file, the file that controls permalinks, writeable.\nTo display hidden files in FileZilla, in it is necessary to select ‘View’ from the top menu, then select ‘Show hidden files’. The screen display of files will refresh and any previously hidden file should come into view.\nTo get FileZilla to always show hidden files – under Edit, Settings, Remote File List, check the Always show hidden files box.\nIn the latest version of Filezilla, the ‘Show hidden files’ option was moved to the ‘Server’ tab. Select ‘Force show hidden files.’\nUsing the Command Line\nIf you have shell/SSH access to your hosting account, you can use chmod to change file permissions, which is the preferred method for experienced users. Before you start using chmod it would be recommended to read some tutorials to make sure you understand what you can achieve with it. Setting incorrect permissions can take your site offline, so please take your time.\nUnix Permissions\nYou can make all the files in your wp-content directory writable in two steps, but before making every single file and folder writable you should first try safer alternatives like modifying just the directory. Try each of these commands first and if they don’t work then go recursive, which will make even your themes image files writable. Replace DIR with the folder you want to write in\nchmod -v 746 DIR\nchmod -v 747 DIR\nchmod -v 756 DIR\nchmod -v 757 DIR\nchmod -v 764 DIR\nchmod -v 765 DIR\nchmod -v 766 DIR\nchmod -v 767 DIR\n\nIf those fail to allow you to write, try them all again in order, except this time replace -v with -R, which will recursively change each file located in the folder. If after that you still cant write, you may now try 777.\nAbout Chmod\nchmod is a unix command that means “change mode” on a file. The -R flag means to apply the change to every file and directory inside of wp-content. 766 is the mode we are changing the directory to, it means that the directory is readable and writable by WordPress and any and all other users on your system. Finally, we have the name of the directory we are going to modify, wp-content. If 766 doesn’t work, you can try 777, which makes all files and folders readable, writable, and executable by all users, groups, and processes.\nIf you use Permalinks you should also change permissions of .htaccess to make sure that WordPress can update it when you change settings such as adding a new page, redirect, category, etc.. which requires updating the .htaccess file when mod_rewrite Permalinks are being used.\nGo to the main directory of WordPressEnter chmod -v 666 .htaccess\nNOTE: From a security standpoint, even a small amount of protection is preferable to a world-writeable directory. Start with low permissive settings like 744, working your way up until it works. Only use 777 if necessary, and hopefully only for a temporary amount of time.\nThe dangers of 777\nThe crux of this permission issue is how your server is configured. The username you use to FTP or SSH into your server is most likely not the username used by the server application itself to serve pages.\n  7      7      7\n user   group  world\n r+w+x  r+w+x  r+w+x\n 4+2+1  4+2+1  4+2+1  = 777\n\nOften the Apache server is ‘owned’ by the www-data, dhapache or nobody user accounts. These accounts have a limited amount of access to files on the server, for a very good reason. By setting your personal files and folders owned by your user account to be World-Writable, you are literally making them World Writable. Now the www-data, dhapache and nobody users that run your server, serving pages, executing php interpreters, etc. will have full access to your user account files.\nThis provides an avenue for someone to gain access to your files by hijacking basically any process on your server, this also includes any other users on your machine. So you should think carefully about modifying permissions on your machine. I’ve never come across anything that needed more than 767, so when you see 777 ask why it’s necessary.\nThe Worst Outcome\nThe worst that can happen as a result of using 777 permissions on a folder or even a file, is that if a malicious cracker or entity is able to upload a devious file or modify a current file to execute code, they will have complete control over your blog, including having your database information and password.\nFind a Workaround\nIt is usually pretty easy to have the enhanced features provided by the impressive WordPress plugins available, without having to put yourself at risk. Contact the Plugin author or your server support and request a workaround.\nFinding Secure File Permissions\nThe .htaccess file is one of the files that is accessed by the owner of the process running the server. So if you set the permissions too low, then your server won’t be able to access the file and will cause an error. Therein lies the method to find the most secure settings. Start too restrictive and increase the permissions until it works.\nExample Permission Settings\nThe following example has a custom compiled php-cgi binary and a custom php.ini file located in the cgi-bin directory for executing php scripts. To prevent the interpreter and php.ini file from being accessed directly in a web browser they are protected with a .htaccess file.\nDefault Permissions (umask 022)\n644 -rw-r--r--  /home/user/wp-config.php\n644 -rw-r--r--  /home/user/cgi-bin/.htaccess\n644 -rw-r--r--  /home/user/cgi-bin/php.ini\n755 -rwxr-xr-x  /home/user/cgi-bin/php.cgi\n755 -rwxr-xr-x  /home/user/cgi-bin/php5.cgi\n\nSecured Permissions\n600 -rw-------  /home/user/wp-config.php\n604 -rw----r--  /home/user/cgi-bin/.htaccess\n600 -rw-------  /home/user/cgi-bin/php.ini\n711 -rwx--x--x  /home/user/cgi-bin/php.cgi\n100 ---x------  /home/user/cgi-bin/php5.cgi\n\n.htaccess permissions\n644 > 604 – The bit allowing the group owner of the .htaccess file read permission was removed. 644 is normally required and recommended for .htaccess files.\nphp.ini permissions\n644 > 600 – Previously all groups and all users with access to the server could access the php.ini, even by just requesting it from the site. The tricky thing is that because the php.ini file is only used by the php.cgi, we only needed to make sure the php.cgi process had access. The php.cgi runs as the same user that owns both files, so that single user is now the only user able to access this file.\nphp.cgi permissions\n755 > 711 This file is a compiled php-cgi binary used instead of mod_php or the default vanilla php provided by the hosting company. The default permissions for this file are 755.\nphp5.cgi permissions\n755 > 100 – Because of the setup where the user account is the owner of the process running the php cgi, no other user or group needs access, so we disable all access except execution access. This is interesting because it really works. You can try reading the file, writing to the file, etc. but the only access you have to this file is to run php scripts. And as the owner of the file you can always change the permission modes back again.\n$ cat: php5.cgi: Permission denied\n./php5.cgi:  Welcome\n\nSELinux\nSecurity Enhanced linux is a kernel security module that provides mechanisms by which processes can be sandboxed into particular contexts. This is of particular use to limit the actions that web pages can perform on other parts of the operating system. Actions that are denied by the security policy are often hard to distinguish from regular file permission errors.\nselinux is typically installed on Redhat family distributions (e.g., CentOS, Fedora, Scientific, Amazon and others).\nHow to determine if selinux is the problem?\nIf you are on a debian based distribution, you are probably fine.\nRun the following command (on rpm based systems);\n# rpm -qa | grep selinux\nselinux-policy-targeted-3.13.1-166.el7_4.7.noarch\nselinux-policy-3.13.1-166.el7_4.7.noarch\nlibselinux-2.5-11.el7.x86_64\nlibselinux-python-2.5-11.el7.x86_64\nlibselinux-utils-2.5-11.el7.x86_64\n\n\nand to check whether it is the cause of denials of permissions:\n# getenforce\nEnforcing\n\n\nOne issue that selinux causes is blocking the wp-admin tools from writing out the `.htaccess` file that is required for url rewriting.

{"text": "\nWhether you run a high traffic WordPress installation or a small blog on a low cost shared host, you should optimize WordPress and your server to run as efficiently as possible. This article provides a broad overview of WordPress optimization with specific recommended approaches. However, it’s not a detailed technical explanation of each aspect.\nIf you need a quick fix now, go straight to the Caching section, you’ll get the biggest benefit for the smallest hassle there. If you want to get started on a more thorough optimization process immediately, go to How Do You Improve Performance in WordPress.\nA broad overview of the topic of performance is included below in What Affects Performance and How Do You Measure Performance. Many of the techniques discussed here also apply to WordPress Multisite (MU).\nPerformance factors\nSeveral factors can affect the performance of your WordPress blog (or website). Those factors include, but are not limited to, the hosting environment, WordPress configuration, software versions, number of graphics and their sizes.\nMost of these performance degrading factors are addressed here in this article.\nHosting\nThe optimization techniques available to you will depend on your hosting setup.\nShared Hosting\nThis is the most common type of hosting. Your site will be hosted on a server along with many others. The hosting company manage the web server for you, so you have very little control over server settings and so on.\nThe areas most relevant to this type of hosting are: Caching, WordPress Performance and Content Offloading\nVirtual Hosting and Dedicated Servers\nIn this hosting scenario you have control over your own server. The server might be a dedicated piece of hardware or one of many virtual servers sharing the same physical hardware.\nThe key thing is, you have control over the server settings. In addition to the areas above (caching and WordPress performance, the key areas of interest here are: Server Optimization and Content Offloading\nNumber of Servers\nWhen dealing with very high traffic situations it may be necessary to employ multiple servers. If you’re at this level, you should already have employed all of the applicable techniques listed above.\nThe WordPress database can be easily moved to a different server and only requires a small change to the config file. Likewise images and other static files can be moved to alternative servers (see content offloading).\nAmazon’s Elastic Load Balancer can help spread traffic across multiple web servers but requires a higher level of expertise. If you’re employing multiple database servers, the HyperDB class provides a drop-in replacement for the standard WPDB class, and can handle multiple database servers in both replicated and partitioned structures.\nHardware Performance\nYour hardware capability will have a huge impact on your site performance. The number of processors, the processor speed, the amount of available memory and disk space as well as the disk storage medium are important factors. Hosting providers generally offer higher performance for a higher price.\nGeographical distance\nThe distance between your server and your website visitors also has an impact on performance. A Content Delivery Network or CDN can mirror static files (like images) across various geographic regions so that all your site visitors have optimal performance.\nServer Load\nThe amount of traffic on your server and how it’s configured to handle the load will have a huge impact as well. For example, if you don’t use a caching solution, performance will slow to a halt as additional page requests come in and stack up, often crashing your web or database server.\nIf configured properly, most hosting solutions can handle very high traffic amounts. Offloading traffic to other servers can also reduce server load.\nAbusive traffic such as login Brute Force attacks, image hotlinking (other sites linking to your image files from high traffic pages) or DoS attacks can also increase server load. Identifying and blocking these attacks is very important.\nSoftware version & performance\nMaking sure you are using the latest software is also important, as software upgrades often fix bugs and enhance performance. Making sure you’re running the latest version of Linux (or Windows), Apache, MySQL/MariaDB and PHP is very important.\nWordPress Configuration\nYour theme will have a huge impact on the performance of your site. A fast, lightweight theme will perform much more efficiently than a heavy graphic-laden inefficient one.\nThe number of plugins and their performance will also have a huge impact on your site’s performance. Deactivating and deleting unnecessary plugins is a very important way to improve performance.\nKeeping up with WordPress upgrades is also important.\nSize of Graphics\nMaking sure the images in your posts are optimized for the web can save time, bandwidth and increase your search engine ranking.\nPerformance testing tools\nWebpagetest is a tool for testing real life website performance from different locations, browsers and connection speeds.Google PageSpeed Insights is way to measure your WordPress site’s performance and receive clear, specific feedback on how to make improvements.The built-in browser developer tools (ie. Firefox or Chrome) all have performance measurement tools.\nHow to improve performance in WordPress\nOptimizing Your WordPress Website\nMinimizing Plugins\nThe first and easiest way to improve WordPress performance is by looking at the plugins. Deactivate and delete any unnecessary plugins. Try selectively disabling plugins to measure server performance.\nIs one of your plugins significantly affecting your site’s performance? Look at the plugin documentation or ask for support in the appropriate plugin support forum.\nOptimizing content\nImage Files\nAre there any unnecessary images? (e.g. Can you replace some of the images with text?)Make sure all image files are optimized. Choose the correct format (JPG/PNG/GIF) and compression for each image.\n\nTotal File Number/Size\nCan you reduce the number of files needed to display the average page on your site?When still using HTTP1, it’s recommended to combine multiple files in a single optimized file.Minify CSS and JavaScript files. \n\nYou can also offload content to optimize your theme.\nUpgrade Hardware\nPaying more for higher service levels at your hosting provider can be very effective. Increasing memory (RAM) or switching to a host with Solid State Drives (SSD) e.g. Digital Ocean can make a big difference. Increased number of processors and processor speed will also help. Where possible, try to separate services with different functions – like HTTP and MySQL – on multiple servers or VPS-es.\nOptimize Software\nMake sure you are running the latest operating system version e.g. Linux, Windows Server and the latest web server e.g. Apache or IIS, database e.g. MySQL server and PHP.\nPerhaps you are unable to perform the tasks, and follow up on the tips, below. Just ask your hosting provider to do them for you. A good hosting provider will upgrade or move your account to an upgraded server, to match the recommendations. If needed you can switch to a managed WordPress hosting solution.\nDNS: Don’t run a DNS on your WordPress server. Use a commercial service for DNS such as Amazon’s Route 53 or your domain registrar’s free offering. Using a service such as Amazon can also make switching between backup servers during maintenance or emergencies much easier. It also provides a degree of fault tolerance. If you host your DNS on external servers this will reduce the load on your primary web server. It’s a simple change, but it will offload some traffic and cpu load.\nWeb Server: Your web server can be configured to increase performance. There are a range of techniques from web server caching to setting cache headers to reduce load per visitor. Search for your specific web server optimizations (for example, search for “apache optimization” for more info). Some web servers have higher speed versions you can pay for such as Apache Litespeed. There are also a number of ways to tune Apache for higher performance based on your particular hosting and site configuration, e.g. Memcache.\nPHP: There are various PHP accelerators available which can dramatically improve performance of your PHP files. This will apply to all PHP files, not just your WordPress installation. Search for PHP optimization for more information, f.e. APC or OPcache. The W3 Total Cache plugin, described below, offers integrated support for Memcache, APC and other Opcode caching.\nMySQL/MariaDB: MySQL or MariaDB optimization is a black art in itself. A few simple changes to the query cache settings can have a dramatic effect on WordPress performance because WordPress repeats a lot of queries on every request. Nowadays, with InnoDB being the default storage engine for MySQL, you have to make sure to use that. InnoDB can be optimized and fine-tuned, search for “mysql optimization”, “mysql innodb performance” or “innodb optimization” or for more information and examples. Search for “mysql convert myisam to innodb” for information on how to convert older MyISAM tables to InnoDB.\nA great example of how WordPress has been optimized was presented by Iliya Polihronov at WordCamp San Francisco 2012. Iliya does, among other things, server optimization for WordPress.com.\nDon’t run a mail server on your WordPress server. For your contact form, use something like Contact Form 7 with free Mailgun.\nCaching\nCaching Plugins\nPlugins like W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache can be easily installed and will cache your WordPress posts and pages as static files. These static files are then served to users, reducing the processing load on the server. This can improve performance several hundred times over for fairly static pages.\nWhen combined with a system level page cache such as Varnish, this can be quite powerful. If your posts/pages have a lot of dynamic content configuring caching can be more complex.\nW3 Total Cache\nW3 Total Cache (W3TC) is the latest generation in WordPress performance plugins, combining the research of web development authorities to provide an optimal user experience for WordPress sites. These detailed guides walk you through\nW3TC is unique in its ability to optimize server side and client side performance, adding functionality otherwise unavailable natively:\nPage Caching: W3TC helps to decrease response time by creating static HTML versions of pages, allowing web servers to serve them without invoking PHP. It automatically updates the cache when comments are made or pages are edited.Minification: Removes unnecessary characters from HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, then respectively combines them before applying HTTP compression on the cached files.Database Caching: Database queries (objects) are also cached, allowing many sites to reduce the time needed to generate new pages. This is especially useful for sites that receive a lot of comments.Headers: W3TC manages the headers (entity tag, cache-control, expires) which control the caching of files in web browsers, reducing server load and improving the user’s perceived performance.Content Delivery Network (CDN): Using a CDN allows you to Offloading resources from your hosting account. W3TC moves the requests for images, CSS, JavaScript and other static files to a network of high performance servers. The server closest to the visitor is automatically used to download the files, providing the fastest downloads possible.\nW3TC can be used to optimize WordPress in both single- and multi-server environments through either shared or dedicated hosting.\nWP Super Cache\nWP Super Cache is a static page caching plugin for WordPress. It generates HTML files that are served directly by Apache without processing comparatively heavy PHP scripts, helping you to make significant speed gains on your WordPress blog.\nUsing WP Super Cache allows your server to serve cached HTML pages at the same speed it serves regular graphic files. Consider WP Super Cache if your site is struggling to cope with its daily number of visitors, or if it appears on Digg.com, Slashdot.org or any other popular site.\nServer-side Caching\nWeb server caching‘ is more complex but is used in very high traffic sites. A wide range of options are available, beyond the scope of this article. The simplest solutions start with the server caching locally while more complex and involved systems may use multiple caching servers (also known as reverse proxy servers) “in front” of web servers where the WordPress application is actually running. Adding an opcode cache like Alternative PHP Cache (APC) to your server will improve PHP’s performance by many times.\nVarnish Cache works in concert with W3 Total Cache to store pre-built pages in memory and serve them quickly without requiring execution of the Apache, PHP, WordPress stack.\nAs described within, using a plugin for comments such as Disqus instead of native WordPress comments can assist Varnish by not requiring your readers to login to WordPress and increasing the number of page views that Varnish can serve out of the cache.\nBrowser Caching\nBrowser caching can help to reduce server load by reducing the number of requests per page. For example, by setting the correct file headers on files that don’t change (static files like images, CSS, JavaScript etc) browsers will then cache these files on the user’s computer. This technique allows the browser to check to see if files have changed, instead of simply requesting them. The result is your web server can answer many more 304 responses, confirming that a file is unchanged, instead of 200 responses, which require the file to be sent.\nLook into HTTP Cache-Control (specifically max-age) and Expires headers, as well as Entity Tags for more information.\nW3 Total Cache integrates support for browser caching and ETags.\nPersistent Object Cache\nA Persistent Object Cache helps speed up page load times by saving on trips to the database from your web server. For example, your site’s options data needs to be available for each page view. Without a persistent object cache, your web server must read those options from the database to handle every page view. Those extra trips to the database slow down your web server’s response times (TTFB) and can quickly overwhelm your database server during traffic spikes.\nFor your site to use persistent object caching, your hosting provider must offer you a particular type of server, a cache server. Popular cache servers are Redis and Memcached. Ask your hosting provider to help you install and configure a persistent object cache, and they will recommend the right plugin, such as:\nMemcached Object Cache – Provides a persistent backend for the WordPress object cache. A memcached server and the PECL memcached extension are required.Redis Object Cache – Provides a consistent Redis object cache backend for WordPress that works with various Redis clients. A Redis Server is required.\nFurther Reading\nW3 Total Cache Plugin (by Dougal Campbell)Holy Shmoly!: WP Super CacheBest Practices for Speeding Up Your Web Site – Expires / Cache-Control Header and ETags (by Yahoo! Developer Network)WebSiteOptimization.com: Use Server Cache Control to Improve PerformanceWP Object Cache\nContent Offloading\nUse a content Delivery Network (CDN)\nUsing a CDN can greatly reduce the load on your website. Offloading the searching and delivery of images, javascript, css and theme files to a CDN is not only faster but takes great load off your WordPress server’s own app stack. A CDN is most effective if used in conjunction with a WordPress caching plugin such as W3TC, described above.\nCloudFlare is a popular Content Delivery Network, which also offers Internet Security services. Plans start from free, but additional features are available for extra costs. CloudFlare is a fixed-cost CDN, meaning they charge by features instead of usage. CloudFlare allows you to route your sites traffic through their network before coming back to your origin host.\nAmazon Cloudfront uses the Amazon S3 service to provide Content Delivery Network (CDN) functionality for your static files. A CDN is a service which caches your static files on numerous web servers around the world. Providing faster download performance for your users no matter where they are. It’s recommended that you use Cloudfront in tandem with S3 and not only S3 alone; the costs are not significantly different.\nMaxCDN is a pay-per-usage Content Delivery Network (CDN) similar to Amazon Cloudfront. Among the differences are support for Video-on-demand as well as “mirroring” (no uploading required) of files, although you can upload them if you prefer.\nAnother alternative CDN provider is KeyCDN. They provide step-by-step WordPress integration guides on their support page.\nKeyCDN and MaxCDN are among the most affordable CDN options available, they’re able to beat the pricing of competitors like Amazon because they are a division of a much larger CDN Providers.\nStatic Content\nAny static files can be offloaded to another server. For example, any static images, JavaScript or CSS files can be moved to a different server. This is a common technique in very high performance systems (Google, Flickr, YouTube, etc) but can also be helpful for smaller sites where a single server is struggling. Also, moving this content onto different hostnames can lay the groundwork for multiple servers in the future.\nSome web servers are optimized to serve static files and can do so far more efficiently than more complex web servers like Apache, for example lighttpd.\nAmazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a dedicated static file hosting service on a pay-per-usage basis. With no minimum costs, it might be practical for lower traffic sites which are reaching the peak that a shared or single server can handle.\nMultiple Hostnames\nThere can also be user improvements by splitting static files between multiple hostnames. Most browser will only make 2 simultaneous requests to a server, so if you page requires 16 files they will be requested 2 at a time. If you spread that between 4 host names they will be requested 8 at a time. This can reduce page loading times for the user, but it can increase server load by creating more simultaneous requests. Also, known is “pipelining” can often saturate the visitor’s internet connection if overused.\nOffloading images is the easiest and simplest place to start. All images files could be evenly split between three hostnames (assets1.yoursite.com, assets2.yoursite.com, assets3.yoursite.com for example). As traffic grows, these hostnames could be moved to your own server. Note: Avoid picking a hostname at random as this will affect browser caching and result in more traffic and may also create excessive DNS lookups which do carry a performance penalty.\nLikewise any static JavaScript and CSS files can be offloaded to separate hostnames or servers.\nFeeds\nYour feeds can quite easily be offloaded to an external service. Feed tracking services like Google FeedBurner will do this automatically, the Feedburner servers will handle all the feed traffic and only update the feed from your site every few minutes. This can be a big traffic saver.\nLikewise you could offload your own feeds to a separate server (feeds.yoursite.com for example) and then handle your own feed stats / advertising.\nFurther Reading\nUsing Amazon S3 / Cloudfront to offload images: Amazon S3 and CloudFront with WordPress,Reducing Your Website’s Bandwidth Usage\nCompression\nThere are a number of ways to compress files and data on your server so that your pages are delivered more quickly to readers’ browsers. W3 Total Cache described above integrates support for most of the common approaches to compression.\nW3 Total Cache supports Minify and Tidy to compress and combine your style sheets and javascript files. It also supports output compression such as zlib, see also Output Compression.\nIt’s also important to compress your media files – namely images. The WP Smushit plugin can help with this.\nDatabase Tuning\nCleaning Your Database\nThe WP Optimize plugin can help you reduce extra clutter in your database.\nYou can also instruct WordPress to minimize the number of revisions that it saves of your posts and pages.\nAdding Servers\nWhile it requires additional expertise, adding servers can be a powerful way to increase performance. I highly recommend reading Architecting a Highly Scalable WordPress Site in AWS A guide for building a more expensive, highly scalable AWS implementation using Amazon’s Relational Data Store (RDS).\nYou can use Amazon’s Elastic Load Balancer to spread traffic across multiple web servers and you can use HyperDB or Amazon’s RDS to run more scalable or multiple database servers.\nAutoloaded Options\nAutoloaded options are configuration settings for plugins and themes that are automatically loaded with every page load in WordPress. Each plugin and theme defines their own options and which options are autoloaded. Having too many autoloaded options can slow down your site. Generally, you should try to keep your site’s autoloaded options under 800kb.\nBy default, autoloaded options are saved in the wp_options table. Autoload can be turned off on an option-by-option basis within this table. For step-by-step instructions on viewing and changing autoloaded options, check with your hosting provider.\nIf you use a Persistent Object Cache, options (whether autoloaded or not) load faster and more efficiently.\nAdditional Resources\nFurther Reading\nHigh Traffic Tips for WordPress10 Practical Tips To Optimize WordPress hosting16 Quick Tips to Improve WordPress Performance – INFOGRAPHIC11 Ways to Speed Up WordPressOn a quest for ultimate website performanceWordPress Optimization Infographic21 easy tweaks to make your WP site load fasterHow to Speed Up WordPress Website with Image OptimizationSpeeding up WordPress load from 4.23s to 1.33s (Case Study)10 tips for better WordPress optimizationHow To Make Your Site Lightning Fast* By Compressing (deflate/gzip) Your HTML, Javascript, CSS, XML, etc In ApacheYahoo!

{"text": "\nNote: This page refers to WordPress using the older or Classic Editor. If you are on a new version of WordPress or using the block editor, refer to this page.\nI have done the 5-minute installation. Now what?\nYou’ve just completed the 5-Minute Installation of WordPress or the one-click install from your web host. So what is your next step?\nLet’s take a step-by-step tour through your WordPress site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please don’t change anything within the program unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, you’ll soon be changing everything.\nLog In\n\nBegin by logging into the administration area, or the back end, of your website. Visit your site’s login page by placing wp-admin after your domain name (e.g., http://example.com/wp-admin). Some themes provide a login link or form on the front end as well. Now log in to WordPress using the username and password you created in the 5-minute install.\nStart at the Top\n\nAfter logging in you are on the main Administration Screen called the Dashboard.  This is where the organization of your site begins.\nAt the top of the screen is the area called the toolbar. Click on your site name; it’s a link and it will take you to a view of your new WordPress site. Like it? Don’t like it? Doesn’t matter, just look at it. This is where you are going to be spending a lot of time!\nTest Drive Your WordPress Site\nTake time to look at the site before you get into changing it and figuring out how it all works; it’s important to see how the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme is laid out and how it works. Consider this the test drive before you start adding all the special features.\n\nThe layout you are looking at is defined by a WordPress Theme. It is the appearance of your website, styling the look of the site and the framing of the content. The WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme features a “header” at the top with the title and tagline for your site. Below this is your Menu, if you have one. Along the side you will see some titles and links. This is the Sidebar. The different items inside a Sidebar are called Widgets. The main middle section of the page is the content area.\nScroll down the page and notice the bar at the end of the page. This is called the “footer.” It says “Proudly powered by WordPress.”\nBack to the sidebar, you will see different sections with information. Among these you may find a list of Recent Posts, Recent Comments, Archives, Categories, links to the Administration Screens, Log Out, and RSS feeds. This is part of the menu or navigation Screen that people will use to move around your site, visiting posts from different categories or time periods.\nTake a Quick Trip Around\nFor now you only have one post. It is residing within a page that is laid out as your home page or the front page. If you click on the title of the post, it will take you to the specific page for that post. The first page or home page of your site features the most recent posts on your site. Each post title will link to the actual page of the post. Some Theme designers design their single post pages to look different from the home page.\nIn the single post, pay attention to the layout and notice what is different about the design elements. Is the header different? Smaller, larger, or a different color? Is there a sidebar?\nAll of these changes are created from a few files called template files. You can learn more about how they work in Theme Developer Handbook. For now, however, let’s get on with how the rest of WordPress works.\nTest Drive the WordPress Administration Screens\nNow that you have an idea of how your site looks and what the different layout sections are called, it’s time to test drive the WordPress Administration. This is like familiarizing yourself with the backend of your new website. In fact, the first page you see after logging in is called the Dashboard, a collection of information and data about the activities and actions on your WordPress site.\n\nThe Dashboard features a list of the most recent activity you’ve accomplished on your site and it helps to keep you up to date on new and interesting bits of information from the many WordPress resources.\nOn the left side of the screen is the main navigation menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Move your mouse down the list and the sub-menus will “fly out” for you to move your mouse to and click. Once you choose a “parent” navigation section, it will open up to reveal the options within that section.\nThe various menu items are as follows:\nDashboardPostsMediaPagesCommentsAppearancePluginsUsersToolsSettings\nLet’s start with the User screen\nClick on the Users tab. The screen will change and you will see the Screen called All Users that shows a list of all your users; from here you can add or change existing users and authors accounts. In the navigation menu, click on the Your Profile menu choice. This is where you will enter information about you, the author and administrator of the site. Fill in the information and click Update Profile when done.\n\nNow, let’s look at some other powerful features of the WordPress Admin.\nChanging the Look\n\n The Appearance, Themes Screen allows you to change the look of your site using different Themes. Themes are presentation styles that completely change the look of your site. Designed by developers and users, there are hundreds of themes available for you to choose from. In your Appearance Screen, you will see a list of currently installed themes, including the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme. To quickly change the theme, simply click on the Activate button under one of the themes listed, then click on your site name in the top toolbar to see how it looks. Wow, you have another look. It’s that easy. Go back to Appearance > Theme and click the Activate button under the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme to bring the design back to what you had. To see it again, click your site name in the toolbar, and there it is. \nCreating a post\nBack in the Administration Screen, take a look at the Posts Screen. You can use the tabs under the Posts Menu to write and manage your posts. Let’s start by making your first test post in the Add New tab.\n\nSimply fill in the blanks, one by one, in the post beginning with the title and then write a little test message in the post window. This is just for a test, so you can write anything you want. When you are done, click the Publish button that is to the right of the post entry window and it is done.  There’s more exciting work ahead! Now that you’ve gotten a feel for writing posts, you can view your posts by clicking your site name in the toolbar at top of the screen.\nComments\n\nPart of the fun of WordPress is the ability to have viewers leave comments on your site. It creates a dynamic interchange between you and the viewer. Do you want comments on your posts? Comments on posts come in a variety of forms, from pats on the back (Good job! Like the post!) to extensive conversations and commentary about the posts. Or maybe you are seeking comments that add to the information you’ve posted.\n\nResponding to comments and moderating them can also take up a lot of time. If they are critical to your site, then include them and consider how you want them presented.  You can make a few comments yourself on the post you created. Take a look at how they are laid out and consider how you might want them to look to fit into the design and layout of your site.\n\nWhen you have reached your decision about how you want to handle comments, take time to read through the article on comments and WordPress discussion options to help you set those features.\n\nPreventing Spam\n\nThere is more to think about when it comes to having comments on your site. Unfortunately we live in a world where spam is a fact of life. It is recommended that you begin battling the comment spammers with the helpful article, Introduction to Dealing with Comment Spam.\n\nCreate Categories\nPosts are usually stored in Categories and/or Tags so you can keep related topics together. Right now you only have one category, but that will soon want more. In the Posts > Categories tab, in the Add New Category area, fill in the information about your category. Continue to add your parent categories, going down the list. Hold off on entering subcategories until all the main categories are entered. \nNOTE:You can add any new category at any time, but make a note of the fact that categories can be sorted in WordPress in two ways: by name (alphabetically) or by ID number. As you enter the categories, they are assigned an ID number. It is difficult to change this, so if you don’t want your categories sorted alphabetically, enter them in the order you want to see them presented on the screen.\nSetting Up Your Site\n\nBefore you get to the graphic look of your site, let’s do a little more administration to your site to set it up.\n\nYou may want to install plugins to supercharge your website, and don’t forget to activate the Akismet WordPress Plugin that is available with all WordPress sites to help protect it from comment spam.\n\nWhen you have the parent categories entered, enter your subcategories. In the pull down menu for Parent Category, you can select the parent to the subcategory you are adding. When you view your categories in the Manage > Categories Screen, you will see the categories listed like this:\n\nComputer Tips\nWindowsLinuxMac\nInternet NewsWeb Page Design\nWeb Standards\nWordPress\nPluginsThemes\n\nPut Posts in Categories\n\nLet’s put some of your test posts into categories so you can see how this works.\n\nFrom the Posts > Category Screen, click on the tab for All Posts. You should see the test posts you entered here. When you hover your mouse over each post title, under the title, you should see the Edit | Quick Edit | Trash | View links. Click on Edit to edit one of the posts. On the right side of the Edit Post screen you will now see your Categories. Choose one of them by clicking in the box next to it. Then in the Publish module above, click the Update button. Repeat this for your other test posts, putting each one in a different category.\n\nNow view your page by clicking on your site name in the toolbar at the top of your Administration Screen. Do you see the categories listed in the sidebar now? Great. If you are missing a category, that usually means that there are no posts in it. This is the default function of WordPress, so not to worry. When you add a post to the “missing” category, it will appear on your web pages. Click on one of the categories and you will be taken to a page for just that category. You should see the posts that went into that category. This is a generated Category page.\n\nNow, click on the Archives for the month showing. Now you are visiting a generated page of your posts listed in chronological order for this month – well, specifically for today only. Two methods of finding the same information.\n\nWhat Is Next\n\nYou’ve now done all the basics for your new WordPress website. You know how to write a post, create a category, and how to view your site’s information by category and archive. You can start the customization process, and when you are done, don’t forget to delete your test posts! Then start writing some wonderful information to share with your new-found public!\n\nUsing WordPress Themes\n\nThere are hundreds of WordPress Themes to choose from. All do basically the same thing but graphically present the information in a myriad of ways. Choose a few that look interesting to you, and meet your audience’s needs and your desires, and then test drive them following the test drive instructions above. Click through the whole site, the categories and archives as well as the individual posts to see how the Theme handles each one. The look may be nice on the front page, but if it handles things in a way you don’t like on the single post, then you will have to dig into the code and make changes. Not ready for that, try another theme.\n\nWordPress Theme DirectoryUsing Theme\nCreating your own Theme\n\nIf you are familiar with CSS, HTML, and even PHP and MySQL, consider either customizing the Theme to your own needs, or creating your own Theme.\n\nWordPress Theme Developer Handbook\nUsing WordPress Plugins\n\nPlugin ScreenWordPress Plugins are also known as add-ons or extensions. They are software scripts that add functions and events to your website. They cover the gamut from up-to-date weather reports to simple organization of your posts and categories. Plugins are designed by volunteer contributors and enthusiasts who like challenges and problem solving. They are usually fairly simple to install through the WordPress Admin Plugin Screen, just follow the instructions provided by the plugin author. Remember, these are free and non-essential. If you have any problems with plugins, contact the plugin author’s website or plugin source first, then search the Internet for help with that specific plugin, and if you haven’t found a solution, then visit the WordPress forums for more help.\nWordPress Plugin DirectoryManaging Plugins\nCreating your own Plugin\n\nIf you are familiar with PHP, HTML, and maybe even MySQL, you may be able to customize WordPress to work the way you want by creating your own Plugin.\n\nWordPress Plugin Developer Handbook\nAbove and Beyond the Basics\n\nThe exciting thing about WordPress is that there are few limits. Thousands of people are using WordPress for blogging and for running their websites. For example, look at some of the entries under the WordPress.org Theme Showcase. All have a different look and different functions on their sites.\n\nWhat you do from here is up to you, but here are a few places to take that first step beyond the basics:\n\nWordPress FeaturesWorking with WordPressWordPress SemanticsUsing PagesTroubleshootingUsing PermalinksGetting More HelpUsing the Support Forums\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/first-steps-with-wordpress-classic/", "title": "First Steps with WordPress (Classic Editor) – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Note: This page refers to WordPress using the older or Classic Editor.

{"text": "\nWordPress vs. WordPress.com\nPeople are often confused about the differences between WordPress and WordPress.com. WordPress is the free, Open Source web publishing software project, owned by no one individual or company. WordPress.com is a hosted blogging service run by a company called Automattic.\nWordPress\nWordPress (sometimes called “WordPress.org” or “self-hosted WordPress” for disambiguation purposes), is software that you can download and install on any web host. It began in 2003 as a fork of b2/cafelog. Licensed by the GPL, you are free to use WordPress without restriction. Sites powered by WordPress may have a “Proudly powered by WordPress” credit, or they may have no credit at all. The absence of any mention of “WordPress.com” is a good indicator that it is a self-hosted WordPress instance).\nWordPress.com\nWordPress.com (a.k.a. “wpcom” or “WP.com”) is a for-profit hosted blogging service run by Automattic. WordPress.com launched in 2005, and is the largest WordPress install in the world. It is powered by WordPress, with some additional plugins and modifications layered on. Having “.wordpress.com” in the domain of the blog or the presence of a “Blog at WordPress.com” promo message or credits image can be used to determine whether a site is hosted at WordPress.com.\nOverlap\nWhat is the overlap between WordPress and WordPress.com? First, Matt Mullenweg is both CEO of Automattic, and co-founder of WordPress. Matt is involved with both WordPress and WordPress.com. Some WordPress contributors are also employees of Automattic. There are many more WordPress contributors, most of which have no connection with WordPress.com.\nDevelopment decisions about WordPress are made without specific regard to their impact on WordPress.com. Any special changes that WordPress.com needs are made on that side, by Automattic employees.\nAdditional resource\nThis video is an overview of the differences between WordPress and WordPress.com:\n\n\nSee more here: https://learn.wordpress.org/workshop/what-is-the-difference-between-wordpress-org-and-com/\nFAQ\nAutomattic’s relationship to WordPress?\nAutomattic uses WordPress to power WordPress.com, and it contributes back code and time to the WordPress project. It is a symbiotic relationship. It isn’t accurate to say that WordPress is Automattic’s product, or that WordPress came from Automattic. Indeed, the opposite is true — Automattic came from WordPress, and Automattic (through WordPress.com) exists as part of the vast WordPress community and ecosystem.\nWhy can’t I call WordPress.com just “WordPress”?\nBecause it isn’t clear what you’re talking about — the Open Source project, or the hosted blogging service. They are distinct, and statements about one aren’t necessarily true about the other. WordPress.com is its name. You wouldn’t call bit.ly, the popular link shortening service, just “bit,” would you?\nWhy doesn’t Automattic rename WordPress.com to something more distinct?\nYou’ll have to ask them. Likely, the downsides of a rebranding campaign would outweigh the benefits. The ambiguity certainly hasn’t been all bad. It makes it fairly clear to users that they can migrate their WordPress.com blog to a self-hosted WordPress install.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/difference-between-wordpress-org-and-wordpress-com/", "title": "What’s the difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com? – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "WordPress vs. WordPress.com People are often confused about the differences between WordPress and WordPress.com.

{"text": "\nIn WordPress, you can put content on your site as either a Post or a Page.\nWhen you’re writing a regular blog entry, you write a Post. Posts, in a default setup, appear in reverse chronological order on your blog’s home page.\nIn contrast, Pages are for non-chronological content. Pages live outside of the normal blog chronology and are often used to present timeless information about yourself or your site – information that is always relevant. \nYou can use Pages to organize and manage the structure of your website content. You can add as many pages to your site as you would like, and you can update your pages as many times as you want.\nAfter you create a page, you can add it to your site’s navigation menu so your visitors can find it.\nHere are a few examples for Pages:\n\nAbout\nContact\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright \nDisclosure \nLegal Information \nReprint Permissions \nCompany Information \nAccessibility Statement\n\nIn general, Pages are very similar to Posts in that they both have titles and content. WordPress Theme template files maintain a consistent look throughout your site. Pages, though, have several key distinctions that make them different from Posts.\nWhat Pages are\n\nPages are for content that isn’t time-dependent, or which is not part of the blog content.\nPages can be organized into parent pages and subpages.\nPages can use different page templates, including template files, and Template Tags.\nSome themes may provide different display options for individual Pages.\nYou can have a WordPress website with only Pages.\n\nWhat Pages are not\n\nPages don’t appear in the chronological view in the blog of a website.\nPages by default do not allow taxonomy (categories, tags, and any custom taxonomies). You can enhance it via plugins.\nPages are not files. They are stored in your database, just like Posts.\nPages are not included in your site’s feeds. (e.g. RSS or Atom.)\nPages and Posts can be interpreted differently by site visitors and by search engines. Search engines place more relevance on Posts because a newer post on a topic may be more relevant than a static page.\nA specific page (or a specific post) can be set as a static front page. Websites that are set up this way have a blog page that displays the latest blog posts.\n\nPages screen\nTo view all the Pages in your site:\n\nLog in to your WordPress admin screen.\nClick Pages in the left sidebar. This will show the Pages screen with a list of all the pages you have in your site.\n\n\n\nYou can easily search for a Page based on the Page Title.\nYou can get a list of all the Published Pages or Draft Pages. \nYou can filter Pages based on dates.\nYou can perform Bulk actions > Edit or Move to Trash by selecting multiple Pages from the list.\nYou can sort the Pages list based on Title, Date, Author etc by clicking the Header columns.\n\nOrganizing Pages\nYou can organize your Pages into parent and child pages and create a hierarchy.\nFor example, you can have an About Page as a parent page and create subpages under it for Careers, Board of Directors, Locations, Company Culture, Press etc. You can also have a Services Page as a parent page and create subpages for each of the services such as Web Design, Web Development, Stationery Design etc\nThe structure of the pages on the site would then look like this.\n\nAbout Us Board of DirectorsCompany CulturePress\n\nCareers\nLocations\n\n\nServices\n\nWeb Design\nWeb Development\nStationery Design \n\n\n\nCreating a new Page\nTo create a new Page:\n\nLog in to your WordPress admin screen.\nClick the Pages > Add New in the left sidebar.\nAlternatively, you can also click the Add New button in the Pages screen.\n\n\n\nAdd a title for the page.\nAdd body content for the page. If you are using the WordPress block editor, you can use the different blocks available in the WordPress block editor to design the Page.\nCustomize the sidebar settings for the page.\nWhen the page is completed, click Publish.\n\n\nIf you are using a classic editor, refer to this support article for details about the Add new screen in the Classic editor. \nCreating a subpage\nUsing Parent Pages is a good way to organize your site’s Pages into hierarchies. A parent page is a top-level page, with sub pages nested under it.\nTo create a subpage under a parent page:\n\nLog in to your WordPress admin screen.\nClick the Pages > Add New in the left sidebar. Alternatively, you can also click the Add New button in the Pages screen.\nIn the sidebar settings for the page, under Page Attributes, open the Parent Page drop-down menu. This will list all the Pages already created in your site.\n\n\n\nSelect the desired page from the drop-down menu that you want to be the parent page for the current you are creating. The current page you are creating now becomes the sub page for the parent page you choose.\n\n\n\nYou can change the order that your pages are displayed when using a default menu, by using the Order field of the Page Attributes module. Put the number 1 in the box for Order. This tells WordPress to display this page first on your site.\nAdd a title for the sub page.\nAdd body content for the sub page.\nClick Publish when ready.\n\nRepeat the process for your other sub pages you want to be disapled under a Parent page, but use higher numbers for the Order field: 2, 3, etc. This tells WordPress to display these pages second and third on your site.\nWhen your Pages are listed, the child Page will be nested under the parent Page. The Permalinks of your Pages will also reflect this page hierarchy. In the above example, the Permalink for the Board of Directors Page would be:\nhttp://example.com/about/board-of-directors/\n\nChanging the URL of a Page\nUsing the Edit option\nTo change the URL (also referred to as “slug”) containing the name of your Page, hover over the Page title of the Page in the Pages screen and select Edit.\n\nIn the Page Sidebar settings, under Summary click the URL link to open the URL popup. Change the Permalink entry to change the URL of the page.\n\nAs you type in a new URL in the Permalink field, you can view the updated Page URL under View Page.\n\nSelect Update to save the new URL changes.\nUsing the Quick Edit option\nTo change the URL (also referred to as “slug”) containing the name of your Page, hover over the Page title of the Page in the Pages screen and select Quick Edit.\n\nThis will open a Quick Edit Panel while you are still in the Pages screen. The Quick Edit panel allows you to modify page details such as Title, Slug, Date, Author. You can also Password protect the page or mark the page as Private. You can also change the Parent page, page order, template for the page and the Status of the page between Published, Pending Review and Draft.\n\nSelect Update button to save the changes.\nPage Templates\nA template controls the layout of your pages. Not to be confused with Themes (that set the design of your entire site), the template affects the look and feel of an individual page (or post) or groups of pages (or posts.)\nIndividual pages can be set to use a specific Page Template created within your theme. You can also create custom Page Templates that can be used for a page. These custom Page Templates will then override the default Page Template included with your Theme.\nThe dynamic nature of Pages\nA web page can be static or dynamic. \nStatic pages, such as a regular HTML page created with Dreamweaver, do not have to be regenerated every time a person visits the page. \nAn example of a static page might be an HTML document (without any PHP code). The problem with purely static pages is that they are difficult to maintain. \nIn contrast, dynamic pages, such as those created with WordPress, need to be regenerated every time they are viewed. The code for what needs to be generated on the page has been specified by the theme author, and not the actual page itself. They use extensive PHP code which is evaluated each time the page is visited, and the entire page is generated upon each new visit.\nAlmost everything in WordPress is generated dynamically, including Pages. Everything published in WordPress (Posts, Pages, Comments, Blogrolls, Categories, etc…) is stored in the MySQL database. When the site is accessed, the database information is used by your WordPress Templates from your current Theme to generate the web page being requested.\nChanges you make to your WordPress settings, Themes, and Templates will not be propagated to pages coded only in HTML. The Page feature of WordPress was developed to alleviate this problem. By using Pages, you no longer have to update your static pages every time you change the style of your site. If written properly, your dynamic Pages will update along with the rest of your blog.\nDespite the dynamic nature of Pages, many people refer to them as being static. They are actually called “pseudo-static” web pages. In other words, a Page contains static information but is generated dynamically. Thus, either “static,” “dynamic,” or “pseudo-static” may be validly used to describe the nature of the WordPress Page feature.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-pages/", "title": "Create pages – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "In WordPress, you can put content on your site as either a Post or a Page.

{"text": "\nYou have the ability to create a network of sites by using the multisite feature. This article contains instructions for creating a multisite network.  It is advised to read the post “Before you Create a Network” first, as it contains important information about planning your network.\nA multisite network can be very similar to your own personal version of WordPress.com. End users of your network can create their own sites on demand, just like end users of WordPress.com can create blogs on demand. If you do not have any need to allow end users to create their own sites on demand, you can create a multisite network in which only you, the administrator, can add new sites.\nA multisite network is a collection of sites that all share the same WordPress installation core files. They can also share plugins and themes. The individual sites in the network are virtual sites in the sense that they do not have their own directories on your server, although they do have separate directories for media uploads within the shared installation, and they do have separate tables in the database. NOTE: Upgraded and can’t find the Network Admin menu?\nStep 0: Before You Begin\nCompared with a typical single WordPress installation a network installation has additional considerations. You must decide if you want to use subdomains or subfolders and how you want to manage them. Installing themes and plugins is different: for example, each individual site of a network can activate both, but install neither.\nThis guide describes how to install manually WordPress Multisite in your current WordPress installation. There are also available ready-to-run packages from BitNami.\nPlease read Before You Create A Network in full before continuing.\nStep 1: Prepare Your WordPress\nYour existing WordPress site will be updated when creating a network. Unless this is a fresh install and you have nothing to lose, please backup your database and files.\nVerify that Pretty Permalinks work on your single WP instance.\nAlso deactivate all active plugins. You can reactivate them again after the network is created.\nIf you plan to run WordPress out of its own directory, do that before activating Multisite.\nStep 2: Allow Multisite\nTo enable the Network Setup menu item, you must first define multisite in the wp-config.php file.\nOpen up wp-config.php and add this line above where it says /* That's all, stop editing! Happy blogging. */. If it doesn’t say that anywhere, then add the line somewhere above the first line that begins with require or include:\n/* Multisite */\ndefine( 'WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE', true );\n\nYou will need to refresh your browser to continue.\nStep 3: Installing a Network\nThe previous step enables the Network Setup item in your Tools menu. Use that menu item to go to the Create a Network of WordPress Sites screen.\nTo see an example of the Create a Network of WordPress Sites screen, look at Administration >Tools > Network Setup. The screen does not look exactly the same in all circumstances. The example shown is for an installation on localhost, which restricts the options available.\nCreate a Network of WordPress Sites page\nAddresses of Sites in your Network\nYou are given the choice between sub-domains and sub-directories, except when existing settings restrict your choice.\nYou must choose one or the other. You can reconfigure your network to use the other choice after installation, despite the advice on the screen, but reconfiguring it might not be easy.\nYou only need wildcard DNS for on-demand domain-based sites, despite the advice that may be on the screen.\nOnce more: See Before You Create A Network.\nSub-domains — a domain-based network in which on-demand sites use subdomainsSub-directories — a path-based network in which on-demand sites use paths\nNetwork Details\nThese are filled in automatically, but you can make changes.\n\n\n\n     Server Address\n     The domain of the URL you are using to access your WordPress installation.\n     Network Title\n     The title of your network as a whole.\n     Admin E-mail Address\n     Your email address as super admin of the network as a whole.\n\n\n\n\nDouble-check the details and press the Install button.\nNote: The installer may perform a check for wildcard subdomains when you have not configured them yet, or when you do not need them at all. Ignore the warning if it does not apply to your network. See the Server Requirements section in Before You Create A Network for information about wildcard subdomains.\nStep 4: Enabling the Network\nTo enable your network, follow the instructions on the Create a Network of WordPress Sites screen. The instructions that you see are customized for your installation. They might not be the same as the examples you see here.\nPopulated settings when creating a network of sites\nBack up your existing wp-config.php and .htaccess files, unless this is a fresh install and you have nothing to lose.\nThere are two steps:     1. Add the specified lines to your wp-config.php file     The extra lines go just after where you added the line in Step 1: Prepare Your WordPress.     2. Add the specified lines to your .htaccess file     If you do not have a .htaccess file, then create it in the same directory as your wp-config.php file.     If you ALREADY have a .htaccess file, replace any existing WP lines with these new ones.     In some cases you might also have to add Options FollowSymlinks at the start of the file.\nAfter completing these steps, log in again using the link provided. You might have to clear your browser’s cache and cookies in order to log in.\nStep 5: Network Admin Settings\n\nAt the left of your WordPress toolbar, My Sites is now the second item. There, all your sites are listed, with handy fly-out menus, as well as a Network Admin menu item. Under Network Admin you can use the Dashboard item to go to the Network Dashboard screen.\nGo to the Settings Screen to configure network options, and the Sites Screen to manage your sites.\nFor more information, see: Network Admin\nUpgraded and can’t find the Network Admin menu?\nStep 6: Administration\nThere are some additional things you might need to know about advanced administration of the network, due to the additional complexity of a Multisite. Even if you’re familiar with WordPress, the location and behavior of Multisite Network Administration can be confusing.\nRead Multisite Network Administration for more information.\nFor help troubleshooting:\nDebugging a WordPress Network\nRelated Articles\nHosting WordPressInstalling Multiple BlogsHow to adapt my plugin to Multisite?\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-a-network/", "title": "Create A Network – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "You have the ability to create a network of sites by using the multisite feature.

Other times, these questions are asked while troubleshooting a problem with a WordPress installation. But don’t spend at lot of time searching your site, or your host’s site, for the answers—there’s a very easy way to get that information.\nThe easiest way to collect the information is to make use of a PHP function called phpinfo(). The phpinfo() function will query your (or your host’s) server and generate a report with a long list of data.

Make sure that you give the file an obscure filename and delete it as soon as you’re done.\nIn a text editor, copy and paste the following command:\n<?php phpinfo(); ?>\n\nMake sure there are no spaces before or after the command, just the command, and save the file as something obscure like sffdsajk234.php. It’s important to make the file difficult for hackers to file, because it will contain information that could help them compromise your server.\nUpload the file to the root directory of your site.

{"text": "\nThere are times when you will need to edit WordPress files, especially if you want to make changes in your WordPress Theme. WordPress features a built-in editor that allows you to edit files online, using any internet browser. You can also edit files copied or stored on your computer, and then upload them to your site using an FTP client.\nBefore editing any of your WordPress files, be sure to do the following:\nWork from copies of backup files when possible, and make sure that you backup your information frequently–while you work, and whenever you make changes. Remember to keep your backups in a safe place!When working online, you need to set the appropriate file permissions, so that you can modify and save files. If you see a note at the bottom of the WordPress editor panel that says “If this file was writable you could edit it…” this means that you need to change the file permissions before you can make any changes.When making changes to files outside of the built-in plugin and theme editors, use a text editor. It is strongly advisable not to use a word processing program. Word processors change quote marks to characters, they sometimes convert specific characters, and they can also add in unwanted code. These changes can cause files to break. (For similar reasons, it is also inadvisable to use certain HTML generator programs.)\nUsing the Theme File Editor and Plugin File Editor\nWordPress contains two built-in editors that allow you to edit theme files directly from your browser. They are called the theme file editor and the plugin file editor.\n(Please note that, depending on the level of user privileges that you have, you may or may not be able to access these features in the administrative panel of your blog. Please contact your blog or website administrator, in order to have your privileges adjusted.)\nWhere can I find these editors?\nYou can find these editors in the following places depending on your theme:\nIf you are using a Block theme, both the Theme and Plugin File Editor will be listed under Tools. If you are using a Classic theme, the Theme File Editor will be listed under Appearance and the Plugin File Editor will be listed under Plugins.\nYou can view a file in either of these editors by accessing it from the right hand sidebar navigation.\nMore information on editing themes is available at Theme Developer Handbook.\nBe aware that if the theme you edit is updated, your changes will be overwritten. To better organize your changes and protect them from updates, consider creating a Child Theme in which to keep all your changes.\nWhat Files Can Be Edited?\nThe following file types (if writable) can be edited in the plugin editor that is built into the WordPress administrative panel:\nHTMLPHPCSSTXT (and related text-like files such as RTF)\nIn the theme editor, only writable PHP and CSS files can be edited.\nThings You Need to Know\nInstant Changes\nThe changes you make to files using the WordPress editors are instant. The changes happen online, in real-time. You and any visitors to your site will see the changes, immediately.\nBecause of the immediate nature of the changes, it’s usually safer to edit copies of your files offline, test the file copies, and then upload your changes when they are verified.\nAlways make sure you have a current backup before editing files.\nEditor Features \nThe built-in WordPress plugin and theme file editors are very basic, allowing you to easily view and edit plugin and theme files on your website. Please note that there are no advanced editor features such as: search and replace, line numbers, syntax highlighting, or code completion.\nHint: Use your browser’s internal search bar to help find code within the visual editors.\nFile Permissions\nTo edit a file using the built-in WordPress plugin and theme editors, the permissions for that file must be set to writable (at least 604). You can change the permissions on files by using an FTP client program, a web-based file manager provided by your host, or from the command-line using SSH (secure shell). Your options depend on the type of access your host offers.\nMake a Mistake? Use Backup Files\nBackup all files before editing. If you make a mistake that causes errors, causes a site crash, creates a blank screen, or blocks access to your WordPress Dashboard, delete the changed file and replace it with a good copy from your backup.\nNo backup? Download a fresh copy of the file you edited from the original source, replace it, and start over. BACKUP FIRST.\nSecurity Warning\nBy default, any user that logs in with administrative permissions can access the WordPress plugin and theme editors, and change any theme or plugin file on your site in real-time.\nTo combat accidents, errors, or even hacking, you may wish to disable the ability to edit files within the WordPress theme by adding the DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT function to your wp-config.php file.\nEditing Files Offline\nTo edit files offline, you can use any of the recommended text editors to create and edit files, and an FTP client to upload them. Make sure to view the results in your browser, to see if the desired changes have taken effect.\nNote: It is not recommended to change WordPress core files other than wp-config.php. If you must change anything else, take notes about your changes, and store a copy of these notes in a text file in your WordPress root directory. You should also make a backup copy of your WordPress core files, for future reference and upgrades.\nUsing Text Editors\nEditors to Avoid\nNote: If you use an external editor such as a word-processor to create and edit files, this can corrupt the file you are editing. See text editor in the glossary for a short explanation as to why you should avoid these editors.\nEditors to avoid include:\nAdobe DreamweaverAdobe IllustratorAdobe PhotoshopApple iWork PagesGoogle DocsMicrosoft ExcelMicrosoft PublisherMicrosoft WordMicrosoft WorksOpenOffice/LibreOfficeWordPerfectAny do-it-yourself instant web page software.\nTo use Adobe Dreamweaver or Microsoft FrontPage, keep these guidelines in mind:\nAdobe Dreamweaver: To make sure your files work properly, delete Dreamweaver content, copy your content from the WordPress editor, and paste it into the Dreamweaver file.Microsoft FrontPage: Do not use built-in templates. Avoid Internet Explorer-specific code.\nText Editors\nThe following text editors are acceptable for file editing:\nAtom (macOS, Windows, Linux, Open Source, Free)BBEdit (macOS, $)Crimson Editor (Windows, Free)EditPad (Windows)EditPlus (Windows)emacs (Unices, Windows, macOS, Open Source, Free)JEdit (macOS, Windows, Linux)Kwrite (Unices) Notepad++ (Windows, Open Source, Free)Notepad2 (Windows, Free)PSPad (Windows, Free)Smultron (macOS, $)SubEthaEdit (macOS, Open Source, Free)Sublime Text (Windows, Linux, macOS, $)TextEdit (included with macOS)TextMate (macOS, $)TextPad (Windows)UltraEdit-32 (Windows, Linux, macOS, $)vim (Unices, Windows, macOS, Open Source, Free)\nIDEs\nThe following IDEs are acceptable for file editing:\nAptana Studio (macOS, Windows, Linux, Free)Codelobster (Windows, Free)NetBeans (macOS, Windows, Linux, Free)Nova (macOS, $)\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/editing-files/", "title": "Editing Files – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "There are times when you will need to edit WordPress files, especially if you want to make changes in your WordPress Theme.

Skip to Automated Solutions such as WordPress Plugins for backups.\nYour WordPress database contains every post, every comment and every link you have on your blog. If your database gets erased or corrupted, you stand to lose everything you have written. There are many reasons why this could happen, and not all are things you can control. With a proper backup of your WordPress database and files, you can quickly restore things back to normal.\nInstructions to back up your WordPress site include:\nWordPress Site and your WordPress DatabaseAutomatic WordPress backup options\nIn addition, support is provided online at the WordPress Support Forum to help you through the process.\nSite backups are essential because problems inevitably occur and you need to be in a position to take action when disaster strikes. Spending a few minutes to make an easy, convenient backup of your database will allow you to spend even more time being creative and productive with your website.\nBackup Questions\nBack up your database regularly, and always before an upgrade.\nHow often should you back up? \nThat depends on how often you blog, how often you want to do this, and how you would feel if your database were lost along with a few posts. It is your decision.\nCan you use this method to back up other data? \nYes. Backups are good all around.\nHow many backups should I keep? \nThe general rule of thumb is to keep at least three backups and keep them in three different places or forms, like CD/DVDs, different hard drives, a thumbdrive, web disk, your e-mail account, etc. This prevents problems if a single backup becomes corrupted or damaged.\nCan backups be automated? \nYes. There are several methods of automating the backup process available, and we’ve listed some in the Automatic WordPress backup section. However, it is highly recommended that you back up those auto backups with a manual backup once in a while to guarantee that the process is working.\nIs there more information on backing up WordPress available? \nYes. See Backup Resources for more information.\nBackup Documentation\nThe following are general documents for helping you to back up and restore your WordPress data.\nBacking Up Your DatabaseRestoring Your Database From Backup\nBacking Up Your WordPress Site\nThere are two parts to backing up your WordPress site: Database and Files. You need to back up the entire site, and you need to back up your WordPress database. Below are instructions for backing up your WordPress database for various server programs. We will start with backing up the rest of your WordPress site.\nYour WordPress site consists of the following:\nWordPress Core installationWordPress pluginsWordPress themesImages and filesJavaScript, PHP, and other code filesAdditional files and static web pages\nAll of these are used in various combinations to generate your website. The database contains your posts and a lot of data generated on your site, but it does not include the above elements that all come together to create the look and information on your site. These need to be saved.\nMost hosts back up the entire server, including your site, but it takes time to request a copy of your site from their backups, and a speedy recovery is critical. You need to learn how to back up your own site files and restore them.\nHere are some methods to backup your site files:\nWebsite Host Provided Backup Software \nMost website hosts provide software to back up your site. Check with your host to find out what services and programs they provide.\nCreate Sync With Your Site \nWinSCP and other programs allow you to sync with your website to keep a mirror copy of the content on your server and hard drive updated. It saves time and makes sure you have the latest files in both places.\nCopy Your Files to Your Desktop \nUsing FTP Clients or UNIX Shell Skills you can copy the files to a folder on your computer. Once there, you can compress them into a zip file to save space, allowing you to keep several versions.\nRemember, keep at least three backups on file, just in case one is corrupted or lost, and store them in different places and on different mediums (such as CD’s, DVDs or hard drives).\nDatabase Backup Instructions\nBack up your WordPress database regularly, and always before an upgrade or a move to a new location. The following information will help you back up your WordPress database using various popular server software packages. For detailed information, contact your website host for more information.\nAccessing phpMyAdmin\nSee phpMyAdmin for more information on phpMyAdmin.\nWhile familiarity with phpMyAdmin is not necessary to back up your WordPress database, these instructions should take you step-by-step through the process of finding phpMyAdmin on your server. Then you can follow the instructions below as a simple and easy backup. For more detailed instructions, see Backing Up Your Database.\nPleskcPanelDirect AdminEnsimvDeckFerozo\nPlesk\nOn your Websites & Domains screen, click Open button corresponding to the database you have set up during the WordPress installation.

For permalinks your server needs to support mod_rewrite, or an alternative. Also your hosting is more secure when PHP applications, like WordPress, run using a separate user account instead of the servers default shared username.

{"text": "\nGenerally, the daily tasks associated with administering your WordPress site are quick and easy to do, freeing you to concentrate on the content, editorials, and stories you want to share with the world, and allowing you to get back to other activities.\nHere is a quick look at the various activities involved in administering your WordPress site. Some of these may need to be done daily, while others can be done weekly, monthly, or less frequently. It depends upon your blogging activity level and the intent of your WordPress site.\nDaily Tasks\nLogin and Write\nMost people begin by logging into their WordPress site because they have news, information, or a story to tell. So they head straight for the Administration Screens > Posts > Add New. There, the title is set, the information is entered, categories and tags chosen, and any other minor details noted, and with a click is published.\nIf you have any new images, movies, or music, to upload to your site, you can easily to that when writing the post or switch to the ﻿Administration Screens > Media > Add New Screen and add any other images to your WordPress site. Then, you can either add these to your new posts, or visit the Administration Screens > Posts > Posts screen and click Edit to edit the post in which you now wish to add an image. Again, click SAVE and it is released to the world.\nAlso, there are those Drafts sitting up at the top of the Write Post screen, which you can publish or move to the trash, if you’d like.\nLuckily with WordPress, you have some options for dealing with all those posts. They don’t all have to be released today. Many people work ahead with their blog content, setting the dates into the future. When the day and time arrives, WordPress will automatically release the post, without any additional effort from you.\nChecking Comments\nAfter you have cleaned up the content on your site, it is time to find out what they have been saying about what you say. On the Administration Screens > Comments Screen, you can inspect the comments posted to your site. If a comment has been marked for moderation approval, it will look lighter colored than the rest of the comments. Click Edit Comment to access the comment and set it to be approved. Click Delete Comment if you want it removed.\nThe Moderation Screen will segregate the comments awaiting moderation from the rest of the comments if you have set your Administration Screens > Settings > Discussion to moderate all comments. This allows for quick and easy comment moderation.\nDetermining which comments to keep and delete is a challenge. Be aware that often nice comments like “I really like your site. Keep up the great work.” and “It shows you put a lot of time and effort in this. Thanks.” might be benign comments, or more likely comment spam. To help you determine and check on what might be comment spam, and how to increase your protection against comment spammers, check out the following documents:\nIntroduction to Dealing with Comment SpamModerating CommentsCombating Comment SpamDenying Access to Comment Spammers with .htaccess\nUsers and Authors\nIf you have set your site set up to allow users to register and submit articles, stop by your Users Screen to check on those who have registered and make any adjustments to their User Roles and Capabilities as needed.\nIf you do allow users to post articles, be sure to check the Administration Screens > Posts > Posts screen for any newly posted articles in the Drafts or Pending status awaiting your review and release.\nCheck the Dashboard\nAt this point, your daily tasks are almost complete. Your site is up-to-date and on its way to entertaining and educating the world. But, there is one last task you might want to check. Stop by your WordPress Administration Screens > Dashboard > Dashboard screen and check to see if there are any new activities going on in the WordPress Community, especially any announcements about upgrades.\nWhile there, take advantage of your handy “To Do List” featured on the Dashboard. This lists your most recently released posts, the next batch of scheduled entries, recent comments, blog stats, and incoming links (referrers). This helpful information lets you know what has been released to the public from your site, what is next on the list, and shows you, at a glance, to view the most recent comments.\n\nThe blog stats and incoming links give you different information. The Stats give you information about how many posts, comments, and categories are on your site. While this may not be critical information, you can use it as a general scoreboard or counter. The incoming links information tells you who has pinged or trackbacked your site. This helps your link popularity for your site and gives you an idea of who thought your site’s material was worthy of praise.\nAt the bottom of the page, you will see a list of your Drafts, waiting to be done.\nAdministration Tasks\nAs the administrator or site owner, there are a few more tasks you should add to your schedule. These do not have to be done daily, but they still need to be done on a regular basis. Many of these are outlined in the articles WordPress Housekeeping and WordPress Site Maintenance. In general they are:\n\nUpdating WordPressCheck for Dead Links Throughout Your SiteCheck in with WordPress for Changes and InformationBackup Your WordPress Site and DatabaseUpdate Your Site’s Content and/or LookUpdate Plugins and ThemesCheck for Validation ErrorsOptimize Your WordPress Site\nMore Administration Resources\nAdministration ScreensWhat Registered Users Can DoManage CategoriesRoles and CapabilitiesManage WordPress SettingsManage Discussion Options﻿Using PermalinksModerate CommentsManage PluginsManage Themes\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/administer-your-blog/", "title": "Administer Your Blog – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Generally, the daily tasks associated with administering your WordPress site are quick and easy to do, freeing you to concentrate on the content, editorials, and stories you want to share with the world, and allowing you to get back to other activities.

{"text": "\nHelp I think I’ve been hacked\nSuffering a hack can be one of the more frustrating experiences you’ll have on your online journey. Like most things however, taking a pragmatic approach can help you maintain your sanity. While also moving beyond the issues with as little impact as possible.\nA hack is a very ambiguous term, which in it of itself will provide little insights into what exactly happened. To ensure you get the help you need via the forums, be sure to understand the specific symptoms that lead you to believe you’ve been hacked. These are otherwise known as Indicators of Compromise (IoC).\nA couple of IoC’s that are clear indicators of a hack include:\nWebsite is blacklisted by Google, Bing, etc..Host has disabled your websiteWebsite has been flagged for distributing malwareReaders complaining that their desktop AV’s are flagging your siteContacted that your website is being used to attack other sitesNotice behavior that was not authorized (i.e., creation of new users, etc…)You can visibly see that your site has been hacked when you open it in the browser\nNot all hacks are created equal, so when engaging in the forums please keep this in mind. If you can better understand the symptoms the teams will be better equipped to provide help.\nBelow you will find a series of steps that are designed to help you start working through the post-hack process. They are not all encompassing as it would be impractical to account for every scenario, but they are designed to help you think through the process.\nSome steps to take\nStay calm.\nWhen addressing a security issue, as a website owner, you’re likely experiencing an undue amount of stress. It’s often the most vulnerable you have found yourself since being on line and it’s contrary to what every one told you, “Hey, WordPress is Easy!!”\nThe good news is that all is not lost! Yes, you might lose some money. Yes, you might take a hit against your brand. Yes, you will recover from this.\nSo, yes, take a step back and compose yourself. Doing so will allow you to more effectively take control of the situation and allow you to recover your online presence.\nDocument.\nThe first actionable step you should take post-compromise is documentation. Take a moment to document what you’re experiencing, and if possible times. A couple of things you want to keep in mind:\nWhat are you seeing that leads you to believe you are hacked?What time did you notice this issue? What timezone?What actions have you taken recently? Was a new plugin installed? Did you make a change to a theme? Modify a widget?\nYou are creating the baseline for what is recognized as an incident report. Whether you are planning to perform the incident response yourself, or engage a professional organization, this document will prove invaluable over time.\nRecommend taking a moment to annotate details of your host environment as well. It will be required at some point during the incident response process.\nScan your website.\nWhen scanning your website you have a few different ways to do this, you can use external remote scanners or application level scanners. Each are designed to look and report on different things. No one solution is the best approach, but together you improve your odds greatly.\nApplication Based Scanners (Plugins):\nQutteraGOTMLSWordFenceSucuri\nRemote Based Scanners (Crawlers):\nVirusTotalSitecheck\nThere are also a number of other related security plugins available in the WP repo. The ones annotated above have been around a long time and have strong communities behind each of them.\nScan your local environment.\nIn addition to scanning your website, you should start scanning your local environment. In many instances, the source of the attack / infection begins on your local box (i.e., notebook, desktop, etc…). Attackers are running trojans locally that allow them to sniff login access information to things like FTP and /wp-admin that allow them to log in as the site owner.\nMake sure you run a full anti-virus/malware scan on your local machine. Some viruses are good at detecting AV software and hiding from them. So maybe try a different one. This advice extends to both Windows, OS X and Linux machines.\nCheck with your hosting provider.\nThe hack may have affected more than just your site, especially if you are using shared hosting. It is worth checking with your hosting provider in case they are taking steps or need to. Your hosting provider might also be able to confirm if a hack is an actual hack or a loss of service, for example.\nOne very serious implication of a hack these days is around Email blacklisting. This seems to be happening more and more. As websites are abused to send out SPAM emails, Email Blacklist authorities are flagging the website IP’s and those IP’s are often associated with the same server being used for email. The best thing you can do is look at Email providers like Google Apps when it comes to your business needs.\nBe Mindful of Website Blacklists.\nGoogle Blacklist issues can be detrimental to your brand. They currently blacklist somewhere in the neighborhood of 9,500 to 10,000 websites a day. This number grows daily. There are various forms of warnings, from large splash pages warning users to stay away, to more subtle warnings that pop up in your Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs).\nAlthough Google is one of the more prominent ones, there are a number of other blacklist entities like Bing, Yahoo and a wide range of Desktop AntiVirus applications. Understand that your clients / website visitors may leverage any number of tools and any one of them could be causing the issue.\nIt’s recommended that you register your site with the various online webmaster consoles like:\nGoogle Search ConsoleBing WebmasterYandex WebmasterNorton Webmaster\nImprove your Access Controls.\nYou will often hear folks talking about updating things like Passwords. Yes, this is a very important piece, but it’s one small piece in a much larger problem. We need improve our overall posture when it comes to access control. This means using Complex, Long and Unique passwords for starters. The best recommendation is to use a Password Generator like those found in apps like 1Password and LastPass.\nRemember that this includes changing all access points. When we say access points we mean things like FTP / SFTP, WP-ADMIN, CPANEL (or any other administrator panel you use with your host) and MYSQL.\nThis also extends beyond your user, and must include all users that have access to the environment.\nIt is also recommended to consider using some form of Two Factor / Multi-Factor authentication system. In it’s most basic form, it introduces, and requires, a second form of authentication when logging into your WordPress instance.\nSome of the plugins available to assist you with this include:\nRublonDuo\nReset all Access. \nOnce you identify a hack, one of the first steps you will want to do is lock things down so that you can minimize any additional changes. The first place to start is with your users. You can do this by forcing a global password reset for all users, especially administrators.\nHere is a plugin that can assist with this step:\niThemes Security\nYou also want to clear any users that might be actively logged into WordPress. You do this by updating the secret keys in wp-config. You will need to create a new set here: the WordPress key generator. Take those values then overwrite the values in your wp-config.php file with the new ones. This will force anyone that might still be logged in off.\nCreate a Backup.\nYou hopefully have a backup of your website, but if you don’t, this will be a good time to create one. Backups are a critical piece of your continuation of operations, and should be something you actively plan for moving forward. You should also ask your host what their policy is as it pertains to backups. If you do have a backup, you should be able to perform a restore and skill right into the forensics work.\nSide note: It’s important you keep regular backups of your database and files. If this ever happens again.\nRegardless, before you move into the next phase of cleaning, it is recommended you take one more snapshot of the environment. Even if it’s infected, depending on the type of hack, the impacts can cause a lot of issues and in the event of catastrophic failure you’ll at least have that bad copy to reference.\nFind and remove the hack.\nThis will be the most daunting part of the entire process. Finding and removing the hack. The exact steps you take will be dictated by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the symptoms provided above. How you approach the problem will be determined by your own technical aptitude working with websites and web servers.\nTo help in the process though, we’ve included a number of different resources that should help you in the process:\nDid Your WordPress Site Get Hacked?How to Clean Your Hacked InstallHow To Clean a Hacked WordPress SiteHow to Cope With a Hacked SiteFour Malware InfectionsHow to Clean a WordPress Hack\nIt might be tempting to purge everything and start over. In some cases that’s possible, but in many instances it’s just not possible. What you can do however is reinstall certain elements of the site with little regard to impacting the core of your website. You always want to make sure you reinstall the same version of software your website is using, if you choose an older or newer one you’re likely to kill your website. When reinstalling, be sure not to use the reinstall options in your WP-ADMIN. Use your FTP / SFTP application to drag and drop the versions. This will prove much more effective in the long run as those installers often only overwrite existing files, and hacks often introduce new files… You can replace the following directories safely:\n/wp-admin/wp-includes\nFrom there, it’s recommended that you be more diligent in updating and replacing files as you move through wp-content as it contains your theme and plugin files.\nThe one file you will definitely want to look at is your .htaccess file. It’s one of the more common files, regardless of the type of infection, that is most often updated and used for nefarious activities. This file is often located at the root of your installation folder, but can also be embedded within several other directories on the same installation.\nRegardless of the type of infection, there are will be some common files you will want to keep an eye on during your remediation process. They include:\nindex.phpheader.phpfooter.phpfunction.php\nIf modified, these files can usually adversely affect all page requests, making them high targets for bad actors.\nLeverage the Community\nWe often forget but we’re a community based platform, this means that if you’re in trouble someone in the community is likely to give a lending hand. A very good place to start if you’re strapped for cash or just looking for a helping hand is the WordPress.org Hacked or Malware forum.\nUpdate!\nOnce you are clean, you should update your WordPress installation to the latest software. Older versions are more prone to hacks than newer versions.\nChange the passwords again!\nRemember, you need to change the passwords for your site after making sure your site is clean. So if you only changed them when you discovered the hack, change them again now. Again remembering to use Complex, Long and Unique passwords.\nYou may consider to change the database user account and password. When you changed them, do not forget enhancing them to wp-config.php file.\nForensics.\nForensics is the process of understanding what happened. How did the attackers get in? The goal is to understand the attack vector a bad actor used to ensure they’re unable to abuse it again. In many instances, it’s very difficult for website owners to perform this type of analysis due to lack of technical knowledge and / or available data. If you do have the metadata required, then there are tools like like OSSEC and splunk that can help you synthesize the data.\nSecure your site.\nNow that you have successfully recovered your site, secure it by implementing some (if not all) of the recommended security measures.\nCan’t Log Into WordPress Admin Panel\nThere are times that a bad actor will hijack your administrator account[s]. This is not a reason to panic, there are a few different things you can do to regain control of your account. You can follow these steps to reset your password\nTools like phpMyAdmin and Adminer are often made available via your hosting provider. They allow you to log into your database directly, bypassing your Administration Screen and resetting your user in the users table wp_users.\nIf you don’t want to mess with password hashes or can’t figure it out, simply update your email and go back to Login Screen, click forgot password, and wait for the email.\nUsing version control?\nIf you are using version control, it can be very handy to quickly identify what has changed and to rollback to a previous version of the website. From the terminal or command line you can compare your files with the versions stored in the official WordPress repository.\n$ svn diff .\nOr compare a specific file:\n$ svn diff /path/to/filename\nOther Resources\nHacked WordPress Backdoors (OttoPress)WordPress Security – Cutting Through the BS (Sucuri)Security Posts (Perishable Press)\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-my-site-was-hacked/", "title": "FAQ My site was hacked – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Help I think I've been hacked Suffering a hack can be one of the more frustrating experiences you'll have on your online journey.

{"text": "\nNote: this page refers to WordPress using the Block Editor. If you are on an older version of WordPress or using the Classic Editor User, refer to this page.\nI have done the 5-minute installation. Now what?\nYou’ve just completed the 5-Minute Installation of WordPress or the one-click install from your web host. So what is your next step?\nLet’s take a step-by-step tour through your WordPress site and see how the different functions work and how to make your new site your own. During the first part of this tutorial, please don’t change anything within the program unless it is part of the tutorial. After following these steps, you’ll soon be changing everything.\nLog In\n\nBegin by logging into the administration area, or the back end, of your website. Visit your site’s login page by placing wp-admin after your domain name (e.g., http://example.com/wp-admin). Some themes provide a login link or form on the front end as well. Now login to WordPress using the username and password you created in the 5-minute install.\n\n\n\nStart at the top\n\nAfter logging in you are on the main Administration Screen called the Dashboard.  This is where the organization of your site begins.\nAt the top of the screen is the area called the toolbar. Click on your site name; it’s a link and it will take you to a view of your new WordPress site. Like it? Don’t like it? Doesn’t matter, just look at it. This is where you are going to be spending a lot of time!\nTest drive your WordPress site\nTake time to look at the site before you get into changing it and figuring out how it all works; it’s important to see how the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme is laid out and how it works. Consider this the test drive before you start adding all the special features.\n\nThe layout you are looking at is defined by a WordPress Theme. It is the appearance of your website, styling the look of the site, and the framing of the content. The WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme features a “header” at the top with the title and tagline for your site. Below is your Menu, if you have one. The main middle section of the page is the content area. \nScroll down the page and you will see a search box, recent posts, and recent comments. These are called Widgets. \nNotice the bar at the end of the page. This is called the “footer.” It says “Proudly powered by WordPress.”\nTake a Quick Trip Around\nFor now, you only have one post. It is residing within a page that is laid out as your home page or the front page. If you click on the title of the post, it will take you to the specific page for that post. The first page or home page of your site features the most recent posts on your site. Each post title will link to the actual page of the post. Some Theme designers design their single post pages to look different from the home page.\nIn the single post, pay attention to the layout and notice what is different about the design elements. Is the header different? Smaller, larger, or a different color? Is there a sidebar?\nAll of these changes are created from a few files called template files. You can learn more about how they work in Theme Developer Handbook. For now, however, let’s get on with how the rest of WordPress works.\nTest Drive the WordPress Administration Screens\nNow that you have an idea of how your site looks and what the different layout sections are called, it’s time to test drive the WordPress Administration. This is like familiarizing yourself with the backend of your new website. In fact, the first page you see after logging in is called the Dashboard, a collection of information and data about the activities and actions on your WordPress site.\n\nThe Dashboard features a list of the most recent activity you’ve accomplished on your site and it helps to keep you up to date on new and interesting bits of information from the many WordPress resources.\nOn the left side of the screen is the main navigation menu detailing each of the administrative functions you can perform. Move your mouse down the list and the sub-menus will “fly out” for you to move your mouse to and click. Once you choose a “parent” navigation section, it will open up to reveal the options within that section.\nThe various menu items are as follows:\nDashboardPostsMediaPagesCommentsAppearancePluginsUsersToolsSettings\nLet’s start with the User screen\nClick on the Users tab. The screen will change and you will see the Screen called All Users that shows a list of all your users; from here you can add or change existing users and authors’ accounts. In the navigation menu, click on the Your Profile menu choice. This is where you will enter information about yourself, the author, and the administrator of the site. Fill in the information and click Update Profile when done.\n\nNow, let’s look at some other powerful features of the WordPress Admin.\nChanging the Look\n\n The Appearance, Themes Screen allows you to change the look of your site using different Themes. Themes are presentation styles that completely change the look of your site. Designed by developers and users, there are hundreds of themes available for you to choose from. In your Appearance Screen, you will see a list of currently installed themes, including the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme. To quickly change the theme, simply click on the Activate button under one of the themes listed, then click on your site name in the top toolbar to see how it looks. Wow, you have another look. It’s that easy. Go back to Appearance > Theme and click the Activate button under the WordPress Twenty Twenty-Two theme to bring the design back to what you had. To see it again, click your site name in the toolbar, and there it is. \n\nCreating a post\nBack in the Administration Screen, take a look at the Posts Screen. You can use the tabs under the Posts Menu to write and manage your posts. Let’s start by making your first test post in the Add New tab.\nThe first time you use the Block Editor, you will see a short tutorial.\n\nAdd the title of the article in the space allocated. Then write a text in the “Start writing or type / to choose a block” section This is just for a test, so you can write anything you want. When you are done, click on the Publish button at the top right of the page, then click a second time to confirm the publication. Now that you’ve gotten a feel for writing posts, you can view your posts by clicking your site name in the toolbar at top of the screen.\nComments\nPart of the fun of WordPress is the ability to have viewers leave comments on your site. It creates a dynamic interchange between you and the viewer. Do you want comments on your posts? Comments on posts come in a variety of forms, from pats on the back (Good job! Like the post!) to extensive conversations and commentary about the posts. Or maybe you are seeking comments that add to the information you’ve posted. Responding to comments and moderating them can also take up a lot of time. If they are critical to your site, then include them and consider how you want them presented.  You can make a few comments yourself on the post you created. Take a look at how they are laid out and consider how you might want them to look to fit into the design and layout of your site. When you have reached your decision about how you want to handle comments, take time to read through the article on comments and WordPress discussion options to help you set those features. \nPreventing Spam\nThere is more to think about when it comes to having comments on your site. Unfortunately, we live in a world where spam is a fact of life. It is recommended that you begin battling the comment spammers with the helpful article, Introduction to Dealing with Comment Spam. \nCreate Categories\nPosts are usually stored in Categories and/or Tags so you can keep related topics together. Right now you only have one category, but you will soon want more. In the Posts > Categories tab, in the Add New Category area, fill in the information about your category. Continue to add your parent categories, going down the list. Hold off on entering subcategories until all the main categories are entered. \nNOTE: You can add any new category at any time, but make a note of the fact that categories can be sorted in WordPress in two ways: by name (alphabetically) or by ID number. As you enter the categories, they are assigned an ID number. It is difficult to change this, so if you don’t want your categories sorted alphabetically, enter them in the order you want to see them presented on the screen.\nSetting Up Your Site\nBefore you get to the graphic look of your site, let’s do a little more administration to your site to set it up. You may want to install plugins to supercharge your website, and don’t forget to activate the Akismet WordPress Plugin that is available with all WordPress sites to help protect it from comment spam. When you have the parent categories entered, enter your subcategories. In the pull-down menu for Parent Category, you can select the parent to the subcategory you are adding. When you view your categories in the Manage > Categories Screen, you will see the categories listed like this: \nComputer Tips\nWindowsLinuxMac\nInternet NewsWeb Page Design\nWeb Standards\nWordPress\nPluginsThemes\n\nPut Posts in Categories\nLet’s put some of your test posts into categories so you can see how this works. From the Posts > Category Screen, click on the tab for All Posts. You should see the test posts you entered here. When you hover your mouse over each post title, under the title, you should see the Edit | Quick Edit | Trash | View links. Click on Edit to edit one of the posts. On the right side of the Edit Post screen, you will now see your Categories. Choose one of them by clicking on the box next to it. Then in the Publish module above, click the Update button. Repeat this for your other test posts, putting each one in a different category. Now view your page by clicking on your site name in the toolbar at the top of your Administration Screen. Do you see the categories listed in the sidebar now? Great. If you are missing a category, that usually means that there are no posts in it. This is the default function of WordPress, so not to worry. When you add a post to the “missing” category, it will appear on your web pages. Click on one of the categories and you will be taken to a page for just that category. You should see the posts that went into that category. This is a generated Category page. Now, click on the Archives for the month showing. Now you are visiting a generated page of your posts listed in chronological order for this month – well, specifically for today only. Two methods of finding the same information. \nWhat Is Next\nYou’ve now done all the basics for your new WordPress website. You know how to write a post, create a category, and how to view your site’s information by category and archive. You can start the customization process, and when you are done, don’t forget to delete your test posts! Then start writing some wonderful information to share with your new-found public! \nUsing WordPress Themes\nThere are hundreds of WordPress Themes to choose from. All do basically the same thing but graphically present the information in a myriad of ways. Choose a few that look interesting to you, and meet your audience’s needs and your desires, and then test drive them following the test drive instructions above. Click through the whole site, the categories and archives as well as the individual posts to see how the Theme handles each one. The look may be nice on the front page, but if it handles things in a way you don’t like on the single post, then you will have to dig into the code and make changes. Not ready for that, try another theme. \nWordPress Theme DirectoryUsing Theme\nCreating your own Theme\nIf you are familiar with CSS, HTML, and even PHP and MySQL, consider either customizing the Theme to your own needs or creating your own Theme. \nWordPress Theme Developer Handbook\nUsing WordPress Plugins\n\nWordPress Plugins are also known as add-ons or extensions. They are software scripts that add functions and events to your website. They cover the gamut from up-to-date weather reports to a simple organization of your posts and categories. Plugins are designed by volunteer contributors and enthusiasts who like challenges and problem-solving. They are usually fairly simple to install through the WordPress Admin Plugin Screen, just follow the instructions provided by the plugin author. Remember, these are free and non-essential. If you have any problems with plugins, contact the plugin author’s website or plugin source first, then search the Internet for help with that specific plugin, and if you haven’t found a solution, then visit the WordPress forums for more help.\nWordPress Plugin DirectoryManaging Plugins\nCreating your own Plugin\nIf you are familiar with PHP, HTML, and maybe even MySQL, you may be able to customize WordPress to work the way you want by creating your own Plugin. \nWordPress Plugin Developer Handbook\nAbove and Beyond the Basics\nThe exciting thing about WordPress is that there are few limits.

{"text": "\nAmong the many user-editable files in a standard WordPress installation are the Plugins files.  Though it should be rare that you need to change a Plugin code, the Plugin File Editor Screen allows you to edit those Plugin files. \nYou can find this editor in the following places depending on your theme:\nIf you are using a Block theme, this editor will be listed under Tools. If you are using a Classic theme, this editor will be listed under Appearance. \nEdit Plugins Screen\nEdit Plugins warning\nEdit Plugins\nThe built-in Plugin File Editor allows you to view or change any Plugin PHP code in the large text (or edit) box that dominates this Screen.   \nIf a particular file is writeable you can make changes and save the file from here.  If not, you will see the message You need to make this file writable before you can save your changes.  \nThe name of the Plugin file being edited shows up at the top of the text box. Since Plugin files are pure text, no images or pictures can be inserted into the text box. \nPlugin Selection Menu\nYou can select a Plugin to edit from the dropdown menu on the top right. Just find a Plugin name and click “Select.”\nPlugin Files\nBelow the Plugin Selection Menu is a list of the Plugin files that can be edited.  Click on any of the file links to place the text of that file in the text box.\nBe very careful editing activated plugin files. The editor does not make backup copies. If you introduce an error that crashes your site, you cannot use the editor to fix the problem. In such a case, use FTP to either upload a functional backup of the problem file or change the folder name of the /plugins/ folder under /wp-content/, which effectively deactivates all plugins until the folder is renamed correctly.\nDocumentation Lookup\nUnder the editor, there is a dropdown menu listing function names found in the Plugin file you are editing. By selecting a function and clicking the “Lookup” button, you can view its documentation on developer.wordpress.org/reference (WordPress functions) or php.net (PHP functions). \nUpdate File\nRemember to click this button to save the changes you have made to the Plugin file.  After clicking this button you should see a splash  message at the top of the screen saying “File edited successfully.”  If you don’t see that message, then your changes are not saved!  Note that if a file is not writeable the Update File button will not be available.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/plugins-editor-screen/", "title": "Plugin File Editor Screen – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Among the many user-editable files in a standard WordPress installation are the Plugins files.

{"text": "\nA Search Page is a WordPress Page with a custom Page template to give users more information for searching your site.\nThings You Need to Know\nDifferent WordPress Themes feature different template files. Some include a search.php template file. This is not a Search Page, it is merely a template that displays the search results. There is also a template file called searchform.php. This is a template file that is often included in the sidebar of many themes and generates the search box form. If there isn’t one in your theme, you can easily copy it from the Default theme.\nTo create your own custom Search Page, you will need to create a Page template to include your search form and the information you want your users to see before they search your site.\nCheck your WordPress Theme to see if it includes a page.php template file. The Default WordPress Theme does include this template, but many do not. If it does, then follow these instructions. If it does not, we have the information you need to create your own.\nCreating a Search Page Template\n1. Using a text editor, open the page.php and save as searchpage.php. If you do not have a page.php, you can create one based upon your Theme’s index.php template file.\nNote: The filename search.php is reserved as a special template name, so avoid its usage; the suggested searchpage.php just makes it easy to recognize in the list of files.\n2. After saving it, edit the file:\n\nDelete The Loop (i.e. basically everything within your content div), leaving the div tags intact.\nAdd a heading such as “Search Posts” or something similar. You can use an existing class from your CSS stylesheet, or create a new one.\nCopy the following into the content div or any other div that contains the content of your Page:\n\n <?php get_search_form(); ?> \n\nAt the top of your searchpage.php, before anything else, add this to give your Search Page a heading WordPress will recognize in the Administration Screens:\n\n<?php /** * Template Name: Search Page */?> \n3. Save the file.\n4. Upload the file to your theme directory (if you made changes to your style.css style sheet file, upload that, too).\nIf you create searchpage.php from page.php in Twenty Seventeen, it would be as like as followings:\n<?php/** * Template Name: Search Page */?><?php get_header(); ?><div class=\"wrap\">    <div id=\"primary\" class=\"content-area\">        <main id=\"main\" class=\"site-main\" role=\"main\">        <?php get_search_form(); ?>        </main><!-- #main -->    </div><!-- #primary --></div><!-- .wrap --><?php get_footer(); \nCreating a Search Page\nBased on the Search Page Template, we will create the search page.\n\nIn the Administration Screen go to Pages > Add New.\nIn the title field enter Search.Do not write anything in the content area.\nWhile still on the same page, look for Page Attributes on right side menu.\nSelect the drop-down menu in Template, and select Search Page.\nClick the Publish button.\n\nIt will show simple search form such as\n\nLinking to Your Search Page\nYou can now make a link to your custom Search Page in several ways.\nUsing the Page ID\nWhether or not you use permalinks, you can link to your new Search Page by using Page ID number of the Page. Insert the next line into your any posts, pages or templates\n<a href=\"index.php?page_id=17\" title=\"Search Page\">Search Page</a>\nOR you may insert the next line into templates\n<a href=\"<?php echo home_url(); ?>/?page_id=17\">Search Page</a>\nUsing the Page Slug\nThe Page slug is set in the Edit Page screen. It is the name of the page if you are using Permalinks. You can manually change this. An example of a Page slug link would be:\n<a href=\"/wordpress/search-page/\" title=\"Search Page\">Search Page</a>\nfor any posts, pages or templates when slug is ‘search-page’. OR you may insert the next line into templates\n<a href=\"<?php echo home_url(); ?>/wordpress/search-page/\" title=\"Search Page\">Search Page</a>\nUsing wp_list_pages()\nIf you are using the wp_list_pages() template tag, the page name would be automatically generated in your Pages list.\nCustomizing Your Search Page\nNow that you have created your custom Search Page, you can customize the display. Open your searchpage.php in a text editor and edit it there.\nAbove the get_search_form() function for your searchform.php within the content div, you can add text to help visitors search your site.\n<p>My Site features articles about\n<a title=\"WordPress Articles\" href=\"/category/wordpress/\">WordPress</a>,\n<a title=\"Web Design Articles\" href=\"/category/web-design/\">web page design</a>,\n<a title=\"Development Articles\" href=\"/category/website-development/\">website development</a>\nand <a title=\"CSS Articles\" href=\"/category/css/\">CSS</a>.</p>\n<p>To search my website, please use the form below.</p>\n\nYou might want to include a list of keywords or other information, images, or details to customize your custom Search Page.\nPreserving Search Page Results and Pagination\nSearch results and Pagination may stop working when applying customization to the search template. To avoid these issues the first thing any developer needs to do is add the following code to the start of their Search template to ensure that the original WordPress query is preserved. To customize the query append additional arguments to (array) $search_query. Execute the $search_query through a new $wp_query object, more information on the WP_Query object can be found at WP_Query.\n<?php\nglobal $query_string;\n\n$query_args = explode(\"&\", $query_string);\n$search_query = array();\n\nforeach($query_args as $key => $string) {\n\t$query_split = explode(\"=\", $string);\n\t$search_query[$query_split[0]] = $query_split[1];\n} // foreach\n\n$search = new WP_Query($search_query);\n?>\nAdditional customization arguments can be found at WP_Query.\nDisplay Total Results\nTo access the total number of search results from search.php, a search result page, you should retrieve the total number of posts found using the wp_query object.\n<?php\nglobal $wp_query;\n$total_results = $wp_query->found_posts;\n?>\nMore information on WP_Query can be found at WP_Query.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-a-search-page/", "title": "Create a Search Page – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "A Search Page is a WordPress Page with a custom Page template to give users more information for searching your site.

The Quick Edit option opens a text area so you can edit the comment without reloading the page. Edit, on the other hand, gives you more options to edit the name, user email, and more.\nOnce a visitor submits his or her comment, WordPress follows your preferences and either hold the comment for your approval or posts it immediately.\nIf you see a comment marked as spam that’s actually a real comment, then you can mark it as Not Spam by hovering your mouse over it.\nComments in the trash section are comments that have been deleted by you. Any comment in the trash can be restored by clicking on Restore. Comments in trash remain there for 30 days after this time WordPress deletes them permanently.\nDiscussion Settings\nBefore you enable comments on posts or Pages, reviewing the options under Settings  > Discussion can help make your life as a moderator easier. Use these settings to restrict comments and reduce the amount of spam you receive.\nNotification\n\nIf you link another site post on your site, Attempt to notify any blogs linked to from the post will enable your site to notify the website owners that you have linked to them. They can then choose to tell their users that another site linked to them through a trackback or pingback.\nJust like the option above, you can enable your site to accept pingbacks and trackbacks from other websites by checking  Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks) on new posts. \nComment Rules\nAllow people to post comments on new articles will enable you to disable comments if you don’t need comments on your websites.\n\nComment author must fill out name and e-mail prevents people from leaving anonymous comments.\nUsers must be registered and logged in to comment will only allow registered users of your site to post comments.\nAutomatically close comments on articles older than _____ days will close comments on a post that have reached a set time. This is a good way to limit spam comments.\nComment display\nEnable threaded (nested) comments _____ levels deep: will allow your users to reply to one another. A reply to a comment is shown “nested” underneath the original comments. You can limit how many levels (a reply to a reply) of replies your site will allow by changing the number of levels.\nBreak comments into Pages with _____top level comments per Page and the _____ Page displayed by default will change how your comments are displayed. You can set how many comments you see per Page and if the oldest or newest comments are displayed first.\nComments should be displayed with the _____ comments at the top of each Page will place newer or older comments at the top of each page.\n\nComment administration\nEmail me whenever … Anyone posts a comment and/or A comment is held for moderation will help you stay up to date on your comments. If you don’t check your site often.\nComment must be manually approved will help you moderate the comments published on your site. \nComment author must have a previously approved comment will help moderate the comments published on your site.\nComment spam\n\nHold a comment in the queue if it contains _____ links, Spam comments are designed to get users to click on links in order to drive traffic to other sites. As a result, many spam comments contain multiple links. Setting this option to hold all comments that contain 2 or more links will help catch more spam.\nYou can experiment with Comment Moderation and Comment Blacklist to catch spam that contains certain words or is posted from a particular IP address. Comments caught through blacklisting are not deleted but instead moved to your spam folder.\nBecause spam is pervasive on the Web, some of the comments you receive will most likely be spam. However, WordPress developers and administrators have already developed a number of successful strategies to help you prevent spam comments from appearing on your site. In addition to experimenting with different options in Settings > Discussion, you can install a WordPress Plugin like Akismet or make other changes to help you keep spam comments under control.\nAvatars\nThe settings under “Avatars” control the images your site displays next to comments. For an introduction to Gravatars, read the WordPress Lesson about  How to Use Gravatars in WordPress.\nEnabling Comments on Your Site\nOnce you have decided on your discussion options, you are ready to enable comments. If you chose not to enable comments on all articles automatically, you can turn on comments for a specific post or Page in several ways.\nTurning on Comments for a Single Post or Page\n\nOn the post or page you wish to add comments to, find the “Discussion” box, and check “Allow Comments.” (If you do not see the “Discussion” box on the Edit Page, click “Screen Options” in the upper right corner of the browser window. Make sure the box next to “Discussion” is checked.) Save your changes by clicking “Publish”, “Save Draft” or “Update.\nTurning on Comments from the Posts or Pages Screen\n\nNavigate to the Posts/Pages screen. In the list of pages or posts, find the one you want and hover your cursor over the title of the post. You will see several links appear underneath the title. Click “Quick Edit” and check “Allow Comments.” Click “Update” to turn comments on for that post.\nTurning on Comments for Multiple Posts or Pages\nFrom the Posts/Pages screen, check the boxes next to the posts or Pages on which you want to enable comments. Select “Edit” from the “Bulk Edit” Dropdown box and click Apply. Then, select “Allow” next in the Comments dropdown box and finish by clicking “update.”\nManaging Incoming Comments\nOnce you start receiving comments on your site, you can check the status of comments quickly by looking at the dashboard, the admin bar, or the left navigation menu. When you log in, the dashboard’s “Activity” box will show you the status of your comments. Hover over a comment to see your moderation options. From “Activity – Comments” you can approve, reply, edit, mark as spam, or trash comments. Alternatively, you can look to see if there is a number next to the comment bubble in the admin bar or “Comments” in the left navigation. This number represents how many pending comments require your attention.\nModerating Comments with the Comment Screen\n\nWordPress makes moderating your users’ comments a simple process. The  Comments Screen lays out the basic information about each comment and lets you decide what to do with it.\n\n\n\nCommenter GravatarCommenter NameCommenter Website URLCommenter Email AddressCommenter IP AddressTime and Date Comment was submittedComment TextComment Moderation Options.

{"text": "\nComment moderation is a feature in WordPress that allows you to prevent comments from appearing on your site without your express approval. Moderation can be very useful in addressing Comment Spam, but it has more general applications as well. If you would like to learn more about comment spam, see Fighting Comment Spam.\nHow Moderation Works\nWordPress runs a number of tests on each new comment before posting it to your blog. If a comment fails one of these tests, it is not displayed immediately on the site but is placed in a queue for moderation, the process of manual approval or deletion by the blog’s administrator.\nControlling Moderation\nYou can control which comments get held for moderation on your Settings Discussion Screen page, which is located under Settings →︎ Discussion.\nIf you would like every comment to be held for moderation, check the Comment must be manually approved option, listed under Before a comment appears.\nIf you would like to send suspicious comments to the moderation queue, while letting innocent comments through, you will need to specify a set of rules for determining which comments are suspicious. These rules are specified in on the Settings →︎ Discussion > Comment Moderation.\nThe first option is to hold comments for moderation if they contain an unusually large number of hyperlinks. Most normal comments contain at most one or two links while spam comments often have a large number. Look at your own comments and set this to a value that makes sense for your audience. (Note: In version 1.5.2, and possibly others, if you do not put a number in the comment moderation links box, in other words, if this box is completely blank, all anonymous comments (and possibly others) are sent to the Manage Comments SubPanel for moderation, even if the Discussion Options Subpanel has no restrictions set.)\nThe second option is to specify a set of moderation keys which, if present in any part of the comment, will cause it to be held for moderation. These keys are specified one per line in the large text area, which is blank by default. Moderation keys can include Spam Words, swear words, IP addresses, and Regular Expressions.\nWhen you add a new moderation key, it’s a good idea to test its validity by checking previous comments. Simply use the link entitled Check past comments against moderation list, which is located underneath the text box containing moderation keys. This asks WordPress to check previous comments and tell you which ones would be flagged for moderation under your new set of keys.\nOf course this means that there may be a lot of comments that you don’t want on your site caught in the moderation queue, and in this case we’ve tried to make it as easy as possible to manage large numbers of comments quickly. See the articles on Fighting Comment Spam for more information and resources.\nComment Blocking\nThe box marked Disallowed Comment Keys works in exactly the same way as the comment moderation box, except that comments that match these words will be deleted immediately and without notification. So be careful! Genuine comments could be deleted without you ever knowing they were there.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/comment-moderation/", "title": "Comment moderation – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Comment moderation is a feature in WordPress that allows you to prevent comments from appearing on your site without your express approval.

{"text": "\nUser Privacy and your WordPress site\nDepending on your national or international privacy regulations (such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation which may be applicable to you) you may be required to display a privacy policy disclosing your collection and sharing of personal data. Personal data includes things like your users’ name, email, birthdate, phone number, IP address and other data that can be used to identify them.\nYou may also be required to provide your users with the means to request a copy of the information you hold about them, or request its deletion.\nWordPress now includes several simple tools for site administrators to take these steps. These tools make it easier for you to inform your users through a transparent privacy notice about data that is collected on your site. It usually includes at least:\n\nWhat data you collect about them,\nWhy and how you collect data,\nAnd what you do with that data (including with whom who you might share that data).\n\nThese new tools also make it easier for users to request a copy of their data or its removal. The use of the new data privacy tools (whether required by law or not) will make it easier for you to protect your users’ privacy.\nPlease note: Every website is different. No two privacy notices will be alike, just as no two site administrators will have identical compliance journeys. Additionally, new regulations, as well as adaptations of existing ones, may alter your compliance journeys. We strongly encourage you to consider that safeguarding privacy is not a one-time responsibility. Taking steps to secure and protect your users’ data is a continuous process both online and offline. These tools can help you with parts of that process, but they are not a compliance process in and of itself. We strongly encourage you to check the regulations and expectations applicable to you and adjust your usage of these tools as needed.\nPrivacy Settings\nThis tool makes it easier to select and build a Privacy Policy page. It will create a dedicated page (or adapt an existing one) and provide prompts and headers to kickstart the process.\nSite administrators can create this page by going to Settings > Privacy, where the Privacy Policy page setting is managed.\nThe prompts and headers provided in the tool by default are based on the expectations of Europe’s GDPR as a leading privacy standard. While this gives you a start to build on, your privacy policy is not constrained by this starter text. It is your responsibility to write a comprehensive privacy policy, to ensure that it reflects all national and international legal requirements on privacy, and to keep your policy current and accurate.\nPrivacy Policy Editing Helper\nThe Editing Helper feature is part of the new Privacy Settings tool. Drawing information from both WordPress core and a site’s themes and plugins, the Editing Helper pulls together a collected set of default texts which detail a site’s data collection and sharing, generating a starter text which you can use to complete your privacy policy.\nWhile you do not necessarily need to use this tool to build a Privacy Policy, we believe it is helpful because it provides information on how your WordPress site likely collects and processes data in core, theme and plugin code. It is important to consider these back-end uses of data: While not all sites will use all functions (for example, an administrator may choose not to enable comments on posts) nearly every site uses features such as analytics cookies, social media sharing buttons, or contact form plugins. Please add as many additional disclosures as is necessary to be fully transparent about how your site uses personal data.\nThis tool ONLY collects policy help texts from WordPress and participating plugins. Many sites will also embed third-party tools (such as email subscription services) which collect data in ways the the Editing Helper tool cannot detect, so the default template may not completely describe how your site might collect data about its user. Take the time to understand how your website actually collects your users’ data, and be transparent about what actually happens with data on your website to your users.\nFurther, theme and plugin developers are invited to learn how the Privacy Policy Editing Helper works, and to feed in the information about how your theme or plugin collects data into the privacy policy tool.\nExport Personal Data tool\nWordPress now includes a feature to to archive user data for export. This is different from the Tools > Export tool which creates an archive file of posts, pages, or media; the new tool exports in captured elsewhere. You can use this tool by clicking on Tools > Export Personal Data in your WordPress dashboard.\nThis tool manages email export requests by your users. Following manual approval, it allows you to generate a (.zipformat) file containing the personal data which exists about a user within your WordPress site.\nWe strongly encourage you use the email validation feature built into the export tools. This confirmation process will help safeguard against abuse, such as malicious users pretending to be someone they are not. As with the Erasure tool, the Erase Personal Data tool uses email validation to send a user’s request to an administrator. The administrator must manually approve the request to send the data in question to the user.\nAs this tool ONLY gathers data from WordPress and participating plugins, you may need to go beyond to comply with export requests. While it may give you a good start in providing your users with the information they have requested, every site administrator should understand what data they collect and process outside their WordPress site as a full site request may have more responsibility than simply using this export alone.\nWhile this tool’s scope covers much of the scope of WordPress user data, it likely does not include information that may be collected by your site using a third-party service, such as an analytics provider, newsletter subscription service, ad affiliate partner or embedded media.\nErase Personal Data tool\nSimilar to the Export Personal Data tool, WordPress now includes a tool to delete a user’s personal data upon verified request. You will find this feature under Tools > Erase Personal Data in your WordPress dashboard.\nWe strongly encourage you use the email validation feature built into the export tool. This confirmation process will help safeguard against abuse, such as malicious users pretending to be someone they are not. As with the Export tool, the Erase Personal Data tool uses email validation to send a user’s request to an administrator. The administrator must manually approve the request to remove the data in question.\nDeleted data is permanently removed from the database. Erasure requests cannot be reversed after they have been confirmed. Note that it does not remove the data from backups or archive files: When using the tool alongside automated backups or archives, we advise you to exercise caution when restoring user data from backups. When restoring an archived copy of your site, your requests for erasure should be respected.\nAs this tool ONLY gathers data from WordPress and participating plugins, you may need to go beyond to comply with erasure requests. While it may give you a good start in complying with your users’ request to remvoe the information they have requested, every site administrator should understand what data they collect and process outside their WordPress site as a full site erasure request may have more responsibility than simply using this tool alone.\nIn particular (as with the Export tool) it likely does not include information that may be collected by your site using a third-party service, such as an analytics provider, newsletter subscription service, ad affiliate partner or embedded media.\nWhen erasing user data, this tool does not automatically delete registered users and their profile data. Administrators should perform that step themselves after successfully erasing personal data for a registered user. User deletion is available for each user in the Users menu in the Dashboard.\nIt is also important to understand that personal data deletion requests are not absolute. A site administrator is not obliged to delete data that they may be required to keep for other legal or statutory reasons. For example, you may be required to keep sales records for a certain number of years for tax purposes. You may also wish to keep a user’s records for security purposes, for example, if there is an ongoing investigation into abuse. These situations should be handled internally.\nConsent of data collected\nUnder some privacy laws, you may also be required to have your users’ active, clear, and unambiguous consent before collecting their personal data. Further, you may also be required to have your users’ active, clear, and unambiguous consent before certain kinds of processing of personal data, if that processing isn’t otherwise necessary for your site.\nWhile WordPress.org does not yet have consent tools built, there are various plugins available to help in collecting consent to be compliant with the May 2018 GDPR compliance deadline. In addition, WordPress Core intends to add additional tools for WordPress theme and plugin developers for consent management in WordPress Sites.\nSome plugins, especially in the case of forms and email subscription services, suggest that you add a “required” consent field that says something like “I consent to my submitted data being collected and stored” if this is a requirement for your website.\n\nVarious notes:\n\nTo-do: Would be nice if we could add a “how-to-use” section by May 25 launch, see Woo article here doing a good job of this: https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2018/05/04/woocommerce-3-4-gdpr-features/\nNote: Leaving in “Explicit Consent” even though we don’t have much to show for it since it’s pragmatically a major concern for major plugins. We should replace with content about WP core when we can.\nWould like feedback on whether to use link one or two:\n\n\nhttps://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/gdpr\nhttps://wordpress.org/plugins/gdpr/ Link two is built by a well-respected development shop and does Explicit Consent the way it should be, but link one is less endorsement-heavy.\n\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-privacy/", "title": "WordPress Privacy – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "User Privacy and your WordPress site Depending on your national or international privacy regulations (such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation which may be applicable to you) you may be required to display a privacy policy disclosing your collection and sharing of personal data.

{"text": "\nInstallation\nHow do I install WordPress?\nUnder most circumstances, installing WordPress is a very simple process and takes less than five minutes to complete. Many web hosts offer tools to automatically install WordPress for you. If you prefer a manual installation you can take a look at the Installation Guide.\nHow do I find a good host for my WordPress website?\nAny host that supports the requirements for WordPress can be used for hosting your website. If you’re not sure if your host can run WordPress the best thing to do would be to contact them and ask if they meet the requirements for running WordPress. You can find a list with some good hosts here.\nHow do I install using cPanel / cPanel X?\nIf you want to perform a manual installation using cPanel you can follow the guide on using cPanel.\nHow do I configure the wp-config.php file?\nThe wp-config.php file is one of the most important files of your website. It’s located in the root of your WordPress installation and contains most of the website’s configuration details. Editing this file can be done in any plain-text editor. Usually this isn’t necessary unless you’re installing WordPress manually.See also:\nEditing wp-config.php\nWhat are the requirements for installing WordPress?\nThe current requirements for running WordPress can be found on the requirements page at WordPress.org.\nHow do I get WordPress to use my language?\nIf you want to change the language that WordPress is using, you can select your preferred language in the Administration Screen. To do this you can go the Settings > General, and choose your preferred language from Site Language dropdown menu.\nDo I need to create a database?\nYes. WordPress requires access to a MySQL  or MariaDB database to store information. So you’ll need a database.\nYou should create a new database if:\nYou have not already created one on the serverYour generous host offers you more than one database, and you wish to have a separate database for the website you are setting up.\nIt is not essential to create a new database for each WordPress installation.\nIf you are using the same database for multiple WordPress installations, take care to edit the wp-config.php file ensuring that each installation has a unique database prefix.If you are setting up a new database for a new website, edit wp-config.php, and be sure to get the database name, and other details correct.\nSee also:\nInstallation, Detailed Instructions\nWhy is my website showing a 403 Error?\nIf the following (or similar) message appears after uploading your website a couple of things can be happening:\nYou are not authorized to view this page. You might not have permission to view this directory or page using the credentials you  supplied. If you believe you should be able  to view this directory or page, please try  to contact the Web site by using any e-mail  address or phone number that may be listed  on the personal.fredsmith.com home page.

As long as you have PHP installed you shouldn’t have any trouble getting started with WordPress. Both Apache and Microsoft IIS are capable of serving your WordPress website.\nAdvanced Installation\nHow do I install WordPress with the files in different directories?\nThis also answers the questions:\nHow can I have my blog in one folder but my index at root?How can I have people see my blog at www.example.com but keep all the files in www.example.com/wordpress?How do I install WordPress in a different directory than where the index.php resides?\nSee also:\nGiving WordPress Its Own DirectoryMoving WordPress\nHow can I hide my blog from people?\nWhether you are testing a new version of WordPress, setting up a new blog or have some other reason to limit access, the following information may help you keep unwanted visitors out.\nApache\nThere is no guaranteed way to do this. You can use the .htaccess file (which also contains your permalink code) to check for certain IP addresses and prevent them from viewing your site. This will only stop the IP address, not the person, so if they have access to an allowed IP address, they can get to your page. One tutorial for this is located at Clockwatchers.com\nAn .htaccess file can also be used to prevent others from “hot-linking” to your images (bandwidth theft) or to set up a password protected blog.\nApache Basic Authentication\nTo require a password to access your site using .htaccess and .htpasswd.\nTools that help you create the files necessary to password protect your site: Htpasswd generator, htaccess Tools and  Clockwatchers.com .htaccess And .htpasswd Tools\nNote: When your site is accessed the password is encoded weakly using Base64 and can be easily intercepted and decoded.\nSearch Engines: Spiders and Bots\nSearch Engines will index your site and cache your content. If you do not want this to happen, you can go to the Settings > Reading from Administration Screen, and Click Check the ‘Discourage search engines from indexing this site’ box to ask search engines not to index this site.\nNote: It is up to search engines to honor your request.\nYou may use a file called robots.txt. More details can be found at  Affilorama.com and elsewhere on the web.\nHow can I solve login problems?\nSee also:\nLogin Trouble\nHow can I get WordPress working when I’m behind a reverse proxy?\nIn some setups, it’s necessary to use something other than the HTTP_HOST header to generate URLs. Reverse proxies take the original request and send it to one of a group of servers. To do so, it overwrites the HTTP_HOST with the internal server’s domain. When that domain is not publicly accessible, at best your images might not load correctly, at worst, you’ll be stuck in a redirect loop. To fix this, figure out which header has the right domain name and add a line to your wp-config.php file that overwrites HTTP_HOST with the correct hostname.\nIf you need to use SERVER_NAME, add this line to wp-config.php:\n[code language=”php”]$_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’] = $_SERVER[‘SERVER_NAME’];[/code]\nIf you need to use HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST, add this line to wp-config.php:\n[code language=”php”]$_SERVER[‘HTTP_HOST’] = $_SERVER[‘HTTP_X_FORWARDED_HOST’];[/code]\nFTP\nHow do I FTP?\nSee also:\nUsing FileZilla and FTP Clients\nHow do I use FileZilla?\nSee also:\nUsing FileZilla\nHow do I upload the files and folders?\nSee also:\nUsing FileZilla\nHow do I CHMOD files?\nSee also:\nChanging File Permissions\nMySQL or MariaDB\nDo I really need MySQL/MariaDB?\nYes. You certainly need the MySQL or MariaDB database servers to power your WordPress blog. In fact, WordPress only supports the MySQL and MariaDB database servers.\nSee also:\nRequirements for WordPress\nCan I use a database other than MySQL/MariaDB?\nNo. Other databases are not supported at the moment.\nThere are several other excellent database storage engines, such as PostgreSQL and SQLite that WordPress is interested in supporting in the future. Supporting multiple databases is trickier than it sounds and is not under active development, although there are plenty of architectural discussions about the best approach to take. Approaches for increasing the number of supported databases are discussed at Using Alternative Databases.\nWhy does WordPress use MySQL/MariaDB?\nMySQL and MariaDB are extremely fast. It is also the most widely available database server in the world. Open-source and free, MySQL and MariaDB are supported by thousands of low-cost Linux (and Windows!) hosts, which means a very low barrier to entry for anyone wanting to start a WordPress (or database-driven) website. MySQL’s documentation is useful, cogent and thorough. (Note: it may be intimidating if you are new to all this.) Add to all that the fact that users are able to directly manipulate MySQL and MariaDB with phpMyAdmin, developed expressly for that purpose, and it is obvious that MySQL and MariaDB are the best choice.\nPHP\nWhat is phpMyAdmin?\nphpMyAdmin is a tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL/MariaDB over the Web.\nSee also:\nphpMyAdmin\nDo I need to know PHP to use WordPress ?\nNo. The only time you would modify your WordPress blog with PHP would be when integrating some of the plugins. In most cases clear instructions are given within a text file that accompanies the plugin. Other than that, you will not be changing any of the PHP files.\nWill WordPress run in PHP Safe Mode?\nMost definitely! There are no known issues with any version of WordPress when PHP is running in Safe Mode.\nDo I really need PHP?\nYes. You certainly need PHP to power your WordPress blog. PHP is the scripting language that drives all of WordPress, and without PHP, your server will not be able to interpret the pages that create your weblog. For supported PHP version, refer Requirements for WordPress.\nHow do I find out which version of PHP I have?\nTo get information about your server, you can use the phpinfo() function. This will also give you information about your Apache and PHP version and  mod_rewrite.\nSee also:\nFinding Server Info\nImporting\nHow can I import posts from my current weblog which uses a different blogging tool such as b2, Movable Type MT, Blogger, etc.?\nSee also:\nImporting Content\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/faq-installation/", "title": "FAQ Installation – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Installation How do I install WordPress?

{"text": "\nWhat is phpMyAdmin?\nAn administrator’s tool of sorts, phpMyAdmin is a PHP script meant for giving users the ability to interact with their MySQL databases. WordPress stores all of its information in the MySQL database and interacts with the database to generate information within your WordPress site. A “raw” view of the data, tables and fields stored in the MySQL database is accessible through phpMyAdmin.\nWhat is it good for?\nThe phpMyAdmin program is handy for performing maintenance operations on tables, backing up information, and editing things directly in the event that WordPress is not working. Occasionally, in the Support Forums, someone will post a SQL query of some benefit or other that can be run using phpMyAdmin. Although many of the same tasks can be performed on the MySQL command line, doing so is not an option for many people.\nWhere can I get it?\nOften host control panels, such as cPanel and Plesk, have phpMyAdmin pre-installed, so there is nothing special you have to do to use it. It is usually linked from the database page. Ask your host if this is available.\nYou can download phpMyAdmin yourself and install it from the main phpMyAdmin project page.\nWarning\nWith great power comes great responsibility. phpMyAdmin allows you to interact with the database directly: it also lets you mess up the database directly.

Additionally, you must back up all of your files in your WordPress directory (including subdirectories) and your .htaccess file.\nWhile most hosts back up the entire server, including your site, it is better that you back up your own files. The easiest method is to use an FTP program to download all of your WordPress files from your host to your local computer.\nBy default, the files in the directory called wp-content are your own user-generated content, such as edited themes, new plugins, and uploaded files.

It saves time and makes sure you have the latest files in both places.\nSynchronize your files in WinScp\nLog in to your ftp server normally using WinScp.Press the “Synchronize” button.\nRemote directory will automatically be set to the current ftp directory (often your root directory).\nLocal directory would be set to the local directory as it was when you pressed Synchronize. You may want to change this to some other directory on your computer.\nDirection should be set to “local” to copy files FROM your web host TO your machine.\nSynchronization Mode would be set to Synchronize files.Click “OK” to show a summary of actions.Click “OK” again to complete the synchronization.\nCopy Your Files to Your Desktop \nUsing FTP Clients or UNIX Shell Skills you can copy the files to a folder on your computer. Once there, you can zip or compress them into a zip file to save space, allowing you to keep several versions.\nNormally, there would be no need to copy the WordPress core files, as you can replace them from a fresh download of the WordPress zip file. The important files to back up would be your wp-config.php file, which contains your settings and your wp-content directory (plus its contents) which contains all your theme and plugin files\nRead Further\nWordPress BackupsUpgrading WordPress Extended\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/backing-up-your-wordpress-files/", "title": "Backing Up Your WordPress Files – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "There are two parts to backing up your WordPress site: Database and Files.

{"text": "\nSecurity in WordPress is taken very seriously, but as with any other system there are potential security issues that may arise if some basic security precautions aren’t taken. This article will go through some common forms of vulnerabilities, and the things you can do to help keep your WordPress installation secure.\nThis article is not the ultimate quick fix to your security concerns. If you have specific security concerns or doubts, you should discuss them with people whom you trust to have sufficient knowledge of computer security and WordPress.\nWhat is Security?\nFundamentally, security is not about perfectly secure systems. Such a thing might well be impractical, or impossible to find and/or maintain. What security is though is risk reduction, not risk elimination. It’s about employing all the appropriate controls available to you, within reason, that allow you to improve your overall posture reducing the odds of making yourself a target, subsequently getting hacked.\nWebsite Hosts\nOften, a good place to start when it comes to website security is your hosting environment. Today, there are a number of options available to you, and while hosts offer security to a certain level, it’s important to understand where their responsibility ends and yours begins. Here is a good article explaining the complicated dynamic between web hosts and the security of your website. A secure server protects the privacy, integrity, and availability of the resources under the server administrator’s control.\nQualities of a trusted web host might include:\nReadily discusses your security concerns and which security features and processes they offer with their hosting.Provides the most recent stable versions of all server software.Provides reliable methods for backup and recovery.\nDecide which security you need on your server by determining the software and data that needs to be secured. The rest of this guide will help you with this.\nWebsite Applications\nIt’s easy to look at web hosts and pass the responsibility of security to them, but there is a tremendous amount of security that lies on the website owner as well. Web hosts are often responsible for the infrastructure on which your website sits, they are not responsible for the application you choose to install.\nTo understand where and why this is important you must understand how websites get hacked, Rarely is it attributed to the infrastructure, and most often attributed to the application itself (i.e., the environment you are responsible for).\nSecurity Themes\nKeep in mind some general ideas while considering security for each aspect of your system:\nLimiting access \nMaking smart choices that reduce possible entry points available to a malicious person.\nContainment \nYour system should be configured to minimize the amount of damage that can be done in the event that it is compromised.\nPreparation and knowledge \nKeeping backups and knowing the state of your WordPress installation at regular intervals. Having a plan to backup and recover your installation in the case of catastrophe can help you get back online faster in the case of a problem.\nTrusted Sources\nDo not get plugins/themes from untrusted sources. Restrict yourself to the WordPress.org repository or well known companies. Trying to get plugins/themes from the outside may lead to issues.\nVulnerabilities on Your Computer\nMake sure the computers you use are free of spyware, malware, and virus infections. No amount of security in WordPress or on your web server will make the slightest difference if there is a keylogger on your computer.\nAlways keep your operating system and the software on it, especially your web browser, up to date to protect you from security vulnerabilities. If you are browsing untrusted sites, we also recommend using tools like no-script (or disabling javascript/flash/java) in your browser.\nVulnerabilities in WordPress\nLike many modern software packages, WordPress is updated regularly to address new security issues that may arise. Improving software security is always an ongoing concern, and to that end you should always keep up to date with the latest version of WordPress. Older versions of WordPress are not maintained with security updates.\nUpdating WordPress\nMain article: Updating WordPress.\nThe latest version of WordPress is always available from the main WordPress website at https://wordpress.org. Official releases are not available from other sites — never download or install WordPress from any website other than https://wordpress.org.\nSince version 3.7, WordPress has featured automatic updates. Use this functionality to ease the process of keeping up to date. You can also use the WordPress Dashboard to keep informed about updates. Read the entry in the Dashboard or the WordPress Developer Blog to determine what steps you must take to update and remain secure.\nIf a vulnerability is discovered in WordPress and a new version is released to address the issue, the information required to exploit the vulnerability is almost certainly in the public domain. This makes old versions more open to attack, and is one of the primary reasons you should always keep WordPress up to date.\nIf you are an administrator in charge of more than one WordPress installation, consider using Subversion to make management easier.\nReporting Security Issues\nIf you think you have found a security flaw in WordPress, you can help by reporting the issue. See the Security FAQ for information on how to report security issues.\nIf you think you have found a bug, report it. See Submitting Bugs for how to do this. You might have uncovered a vulnerability, or a bug that could lead to one.\nWeb Server Vulnerabilities\nThe web server running WordPress, and the software on it, can have vulnerabilities. Therefore, make sure you are running secure, stable versions of your web server and the software on it, or make sure you are using a trusted host that takes care of these things for you.\nIf you’re on a shared server (one that hosts other websites besides your own) and a website on the same server is compromised, your website can potentially be compromised too even if you follow everything in this guide. Be sure to ask your web host what security precautions they take.\nNetwork Vulnerabilities\nThe network on both ends — the WordPress server side and the client network side — should be trusted. That means updating firewall rules on your home router and being careful about what networks you work from. An Internet cafe where you are sending passwords over an unencrypted connection, wireless or otherwise, is not a trusted network.\nYour web host should be making sure that their network is not compromised by attackers, and you should do the same. Network vulnerabilities can allow passwords and other sensitive information to be intercepted.\nPasswords\nMany potential vulnerabilities can be avoided with good security habits. A strong password is an important aspect of this.\nThe goal with your password is to make it hard for other people to guess and hard for a brute force attack to succeed. Many automatic password generators are available that can be used to create secure passwords.\nWordPress also features a password strength meter which is shown when changing your password in WordPress. Use this when changing your password to ensure its strength is adequate.\nThings to avoid when choosing a password:\nAny permutation of your own real name, username, company name, or name of your website.A word from a dictionary, in any language.A short password.Any numeric-only or alphabetic-only password (a mixture of both is best).\nA strong password is necessary not just to protect your blog content. A hacker who gains access to your administrator account is able to install malicious scripts that can potentially compromise your entire server.\nIn addition to using a strong password, it’s a good idea to enable two-step authentication as an additional security measure.\nFTP\nWhen connecting to your server you should use SFTP encryption if your web host provides it. If you are unsure if your web host provides SFTP or not, just ask them.\nUsing SFTP is the same as FTP, except your password and other data is encrypted as it is transmitted between your computer and your website. This means your password is never sent in the clear and cannot be intercepted by an attacker.\nFile Permissions\nSome neat features of WordPress come from allowing various files to be writable by the web server. However, allowing write access to your files is potentially dangerous, particularly in a shared hosting environment.\nIt is best to lock down your file permissions as much as possible and to loosen those restrictions on the occasions that you need to allow write access, or to create specific folders with less restrictions for the purpose of doing things like uploading files.\nHere is one possible permission scheme.\nAll files should be owned by your user account, and should be writable by you. Any file that needs write access from WordPress should be writable by the web server, if your hosting set up requires it, that may mean those files need to be group-owned by the user account used by the web server process.\n/ \nThe root WordPress directory: all files should be writable only by your user account, except .htaccess if you want WordPress to automatically generate rewrite rules for you.\n/wp-admin/ \nThe WordPress administration area: all files should be writable only by your user account.\n/wp-includes/ \nThe bulk of WordPress application logic: all files should be writable only by your user account.\n/wp-content/ \nUser-supplied content: intended to be writable by your user account and the web server process.\nWithin /wp-content/ you will find:\n/wp-content/themes/ \nTheme files. If you want to use the built-in theme editor, all files need to be writable by the web server process. If you do not want to use the built-in theme editor, all files can be writable only by your user account.\n/wp-content/plugins/ \nPlugin files: all files should be writable only by your user account.\nOther directories that may be present with /wp-content/ should be documented by whichever plugin or theme requires them. Permissions may vary.\nChanging file permissions\nIf you have shell access to your server, you can change file permissions recursively with the following command:\nFor Directories:\nfind /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\nFor Files:\nfind /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\nRegarding Automatic Updates\nWhen you tell WordPress to perform an automatic update, all file operations are performed as the user that owns the files, not as the web server’s user. All files are set to 0644 and all directories are set to 0755, and writable by only the user and readable by everyone else, including the web server.\nDatabase Security\nIf you run multiple blogs on the same server, it is wise to consider keeping them in separate databases each managed by a different user. This is best accomplished when performing the initial WordPress installation. This is a containment strategy: if an intruder successfully cracks one WordPress installation, this makes it that much harder to alter your other blogs.\nIf you administer MySQL yourself, ensure that you understand your MySQL configuration and that unneeded features (such as accepting remote TCP connections) are disabled. See Secure MySQL Database Design for a nice introduction.\nRestricting Database User Privileges\nFor normal WordPress operations, such as posting blog posts, uploading media files, posting comments, creating new WordPress users and installing WordPress plugins, the MySQL database user only needs data read and data write privileges to the MySQL database; SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE.\nTherefore any other database structure and administration privileges, such as DROP, ALTER and GRANT can be revoked. By revoking such privileges you are also improving the containment policies.\nNote: Some plugins, themes and major WordPress updates might require to make database structural changes, such as add new tables or change the schema. In such case, before installing the plugin or updating a software, you will need to temporarily allow the database user the required privileges.\nWARNING: Attempting updates without having these privileges can cause problems when database schema changes occur. Thus, it is NOT recommended to revoke these privileges. If you do feel the need to do this for security reasons, then please make sure that you have a solid backup plan in place first, with regular whole database backups which you have tested are valid and that can be easily restored. A failed database upgrade can usually be solved by restoring the database back to an old version, granting the proper permissions, and then letting WordPress try the database update again. Restoring the database will return it back to that old version and the WordPress administration screens will then detect the old version and allow you to run the necessary SQL commands on it. Most WordPress upgrades do not change the schema, but some do. Only major point upgrades (3.7 to 3.8, for example) will alter the schema. Minor upgrades (3.8 to 3.8.1) will generally not. Nevertheless, keep a regular backup.\nSecuring wp-admin\nAdding server-side password protection (such as BasicAuth) to /wp-admin/ adds a second layer of protection around your blog’s admin area, the login screen, and your files. This forces an attacker or bot to attack this second layer of protection instead of your actual admin files. Many WordPress attacks are carried out autonomously by malicious software bots.\nSimply securing the wp-admin/ directory might also break some WordPress functionality, such as the AJAX handler at wp-admin/admin-ajax.php. See the Resources section for more documentation on how to password protect your wp-admin/ directory properly.\nThe most common attacks against a WordPress blog usually fall into two categories.\nSending specially-crafted HTTP requests to your server with specific exploit payloads for specific vulnerabilities. These include old/outdated plugins and software.Attempting to gain access to your blog by using “brute-force” password guessing.\nThe ultimate implementation of this “second layer” password protection is to require an HTTPS SSL encrypted connection for administration, so that all communication and sensitive data is encrypted. See Administration Over SSL.\nSecuring wp-includes\nA second layer of protection can be added where scripts are generally not intended to be accessed by any user. One way to do that is to block those scripts using mod_rewrite in the .htaccess file. Note: to ensure the code below is not overwritten by WordPress, place it outside the # BEGIN WordPress and # END WordPress tags in the .htaccess file. WordPress can overwrite anything between these tags.\n# Block the include-only files.\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^wp-admin/includes/ - [F,L]\nRewriteRule !^wp-includes/ - [S=3]\nRewriteRule ^wp-includes/[^/]+\\.php$ - [F,L]\nRewriteRule ^wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/.+\\.php - [F,L]\nRewriteRule ^wp-includes/theme-compat/ - [F,L]\n</IfModule>\n\n\n# BEGIN WordPress\nNote that this won’t work well on Multisite, as RewriteRule ^wp-includes/[^/]+\\.php$ - [F,L] would prevent the ms-files.php file from generating images. Omitting that line will allow the code to work, but offers less security.\nSecuring wp-config.php\nYou can move the wp-config.php file to the directory above your WordPress install. This means for a site installed in the root of your webspace, you can store wp-config.php outside the web-root folder.\nNote: Some people assert that moving wp-config.php has minimal security benefits and, if not done carefully, may actually introduce serious vulnerabilities. Others disagree.\nNote that wp-config.php can be stored ONE directory level above the WordPress (where wp-includes resides) installation. Also, make sure that only you (and the web server) can read this file (it generally means a 400 or 440 permission).\nIf you use a server with .htaccess, you can put this in that file (at the very top) to deny access to anyone surfing for it:\n<files wp-config.php>\norder allow,deny\ndeny from all\n</files>\nDisable File Editing\nThe WordPress Dashboard by default allows administrators to edit PHP files, such as plugin and theme files. This is often the first tool an attacker will use if able to login, since it allows code execution. WordPress has a constant to disable editing from Dashboard. Placing this line in wp-config.php is equivalent to removing the ‘edit_themes’, ‘edit_plugins’ and ‘edit_files’ capabilities of all users:\ndefine('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);\nThis will not prevent an attacker from uploading malicious files to your site, but might stop some attacks.\nPlugins\nFirst of all, make sure your plugins are always updated. Also, if you are not using a specific plugin, delete it from the system.\nFirewall\nThere are many plugins and services that can act as a firewall for your website. Some of them work by modifying your .htaccess\nfile and restricting some access at the Apache level, before it is processed by WordPress. A good example is iThemes Security or All in One WP Security. Some firewall plugins act at the WordPress level, like WordFence and Shield, and try to filter attacks as WordPress is loading, but before it is fully processed.\nBesides plugins, you can also install a WAF (web firewall) at your web server to filter content before it is processed by WordPress. The most popular open source WAF is ModSecurity.\nA website firewall can also be added as intermediary between the traffic from the internet and your hosting server. These services all function as reverse proxies, in which they accept the initial requests and reroute them to your server, stripping it of all malicious requests. They accomplish this by modifying your DNS records, via an A record or full DNS swap, allowing all traffic to pass through the new network first. This causes all traffic to be filtered by the firewall before reaching your site. A few companies offer such service, like CloudFlare, Sucuri and Incapsula.\nAdditionally, these third parties service providers function as Content Distribution Network (CDNs) by default, introducing performance optimization and global reach.\nPlugins that need write access\nIf a plugin wants write access to your WordPress files and directories, please read the code to make sure it is legit or check with someone you trust. Possible places to check are the Support Forums and IRC Channel.\nCode execution plugins\nAs we said, part of the goal of hardening WordPress is containing the damage done if there is a successful attack. Plugins which allow arbitrary PHP or other code to execute from entries in a database effectively magnify the possibility of damage in the event of a successful attack.\nA way to avoid using such a plugin is to use custom page templates that call the function. Part of the security this affords is active only when you disallow file editing within WordPress.\nSecurity through obscurity\nSecurity through obscurity is generally an unsound primary strategy. However, there are areas in WordPress where obscuring information might help with security:\nRename the administrative account: When creating an administrative account, avoid easily guessed terms such as admin or webmaster as usernames because they are typically subject to attacks first. On an existing WordPress install you may rename the existing account in the MySQL command-line client with a command like UPDATE wp_users SET user_login = 'newuser' WHERE user_login = 'admin';, or by using a MySQL frontend like phpMyAdmin.Change the table_prefix: Many published WordPress-specific SQL-injection attacks make the assumption that the table_prefix is wp_, the default. Changing this can block at least some SQL injection attacks.\nData Backups\nBack up your data regularly, including your MySQL databases. See the main article: Backing Up Your Database.\nData integrity is critical for trusted backups. Encrypting the backup, keeping an independent record of MD5 hashes for each backup file, and/or placing backups on read-only media increases your confidence that your data has not been tampered with.\nA sound backup strategy could include keeping a set of regularly-timed snapshots of your entire WordPress installation (including WordPress core files and your database) in a trusted location. Imagine a site that makes weekly snapshots. Such a strategy means that if a site is compromised on May 1st but the compromise is not detected until May 12th, the site owner will have pre-compromise backups that can help in rebuilding the site and possibly even post-compromise backups which will aid in determining how the site was compromised.\nLogging\nLogs are your best friend when it comes to understanding what is happening with your website, especially if you’re trying to perform forensics. Contrary to popular beliefs, logs allow you to see what was done and by who and when. Unfortunately the logs will not tell you who, username, logged in, but it will allow you to identify the IP and time and more importantly, the actions the attacker might have taken. You will be able to see any of these attacks via the logs – Cross Site Scripting (XSS), Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Local File Inclusion (LFI) and Directory Traversal attempts. You will also be able to see brute force attempts. There are various examples and tutorials available to help guide you through the process of parsing and analyzing your raw logs.\nIf you get more comfortable with your logs you’ll be able to see things like, when the theme and plugin editors are being used, when someone updates your widgets and when posts and pages are added. All key elements when doing forensic work on your web server. The are a few WordPress Security plugins that assist you with this as well, like the Sucuri Auditing tool or the Audit Trail plugin.\nThere are two key open-source solutions you’ll want on your web server from a security perspective, this is a layered approach to security.\nOSSEC can run on any NIX distribution and will also run on Windows. When configured correctly its very powerful. The idea is correlate and aggregate all the logs. You have to be sure to configure it to capture all access_logs and error_logs and if you have multiple websites on the server account for that. You’ll also want to be sure to filter out the noise. By default you’ll see a lot of noise and you’ll want to configure it to be really effective.\nMonitoring\nSometimes prevention is not enough and you may still be hacked. That’s why intrusion detection/monitoring is very important. It will allow you to react faster, find out what happened and recover your site.\nMonitoring your logs\nIf you are on a dedicated or virtual private server, in which you have the luxury of root access, you have the ability easily configure things so that you can see what’s going on. OSSEC easily facilitates this and here is a little write up that might help you out OSSEC for Website Security – Part I.\nMonitoring your files for changes\nWhen an attack happens, it always leave traces. Either on the logs or on the file system (new files, modified files, etc). If you are using OSSEC for example, it will monitor your files and alert you when they change.\nGoals\nThe goals of file system tracking include:\nMonitor changed and added filesLog changes and additionsAbility to revert granular changesAutomated alerts\nGeneral approaches\nAdministrators can monitor file system via general technologies such as:\nSystem utilitiesRevision controlOS/kernel level monitoring\nSpecific tools\nOptions for file system monitoring include:\ndiff – build clean test copy of your site and compare against productionGit – source code managementinotify and incron – OS kernel level file monitoring service that can run commands on filesystem eventsWatcher – Python inotify libraryOSSEC – Open Source Host-based Intrusion Detection System that performs log analysis, file integrity checking, policy monitoring, rootkit detection, real-time alerting and active response.\nConsiderations\nWhen configuring a file based monitoring strategy, there are many considerations, including the following.\nRun the monitoring script/service as root\nThis would make it hard for attackers to disable or modify your file system monitoring solution.\nDisable monitoring during scheduled maintenance/upgrades\nThis would prevent unnecessary notifications when you are performing regular maintenance on the site.\nMonitor only executable filetypes\nIt may be reasonably safe to monitor only executable file types, such as .php files, etc.. Filtering out non-executable files may reduce unnecessary log entries and alerts.\nUse strict file system permissions\nRead about securing file permissions and ownership. In general, avoid allowing execute and write permissions to the extent possible.\nMonitoring your web server externally\nIf the attacker tries to deface your site or add malware, you can also detect these changes by using a web-based integrity monitor solution. This comes in many forms today, use your favorite search engine and look for Web Malware Detection and Remediation and you’ll likely get a long list of service providers.\nResources\nHow to Improve WordPress Security (Infographic)Security PluginsWordPress Security Cutting Through the BSe-Book: Locking Down WordPresswpsecure.net has a few guides on how to lock down WordPress.A Beginners Guide to Hardening WordPressBrad Williams: Lock it Up (Video)21 Ways to Secure Your WordPress SiteOfficial docs on how to password protect directories with an .htaccess fileSimple tutorial on how to password protect the WordPress admin area and fix the 404 error\nSee Also\nSecurity FAQFAQ – My site was hackedBrute Force AttacksWordPress Security Whitepaper\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/hardening-wordpress/", "title": "Hardening WordPress – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Security in WordPress is taken very seriously, but as with any other system there are potential security issues that may arise if some basic security precautions aren't taken.

{"text": "\nWordPress is well-known for its ease of installation. Under most circumstances, installing WordPress is a very simple process and takes less than five minutes to complete. Many web hosts now offer tools (e.g. Fantastico) to automatically install WordPress for you. However, if you wish to install WordPress yourself, the following guide will help.\nThings to Know Before Installing WordPress\nBefore you begin the install, there are a few things you need to have and do. Refer the article Before You Install.If you need multiple WordPress instances, refer Installing Multiple WordPress Instances.\nBasic Instructions\nHere’s the quick version of the instructions for those who are already comfortable with performing such installations. More detailed instructions follow.\n\nDownload and unzip the WordPress package if you haven’t already.\nCreate a database for WordPress on your web server, as well as a MySQL (or MariaDB) user who has all privileges for accessing and modifying it.\n(Optional) Find and rename wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php, then edit the file (see Editing wp-config.php) and add your database information.Note: If you are not comfortable with renaming files, step 3 is optional and you can skip it as the install program will create the wp-config.php file for you.\nUpload the WordPress files to the desired location on your web server:\n\nIf you want to integrate WordPress into the root of your domain (e.g. http://example.com/), move or upload all contents of the unzipped WordPress directory (excluding the WordPress directory itself) into the root directory of your web server.\nIf you want to have your WordPress installation in its own subdirectory on your website (e.g. http://example.com/blog/), create the blog directory on your server and upload the contents of the unzipped WordPress package to the directory via FTP.\nNote: If your FTP client has an option to convert file names to lower case, make sure it’s disabled.\n\n\nRun the WordPress installation script by accessing the URL in a web browser. This should be the URL where you uploaded the WordPress files.\n\nIf you installed WordPress in the root directory, you should visit: http://example.com/\nIf you installed WordPress in its own subdirectory called blog, for example, you should visit: http://example.com/blog/\n\n\n\nThat’s it! WordPress should now be installed.\nDetailed Instructions\nStep 1: Download and Extract\nDownload and unzip the WordPress package from https://wordpress.org/download/.\n\nIf you will be uploading WordPress to a remote web server, download the WordPress package to your computer with a web browser and unzip the package.\nIf you will be using FTP, skip to the next step – uploading files is covered later.\nIf you have shell access to your web server, and are comfortable using console-based tools, you may wish to download WordPress directly to your web server using wget (or lynx or another console-based web browser) if you want to avoid FTPing:\n\nwget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz\nThen extract the package using:tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz \n\nThe WordPress package will extract into a folder called wordpress in the same directory that you downloaded latest.tar.gz.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create the Database and a User\nIf you are using a hosting provider, you may already have a WordPress database set up for you, or there may be an automated setup solution to do so. Check your hosting provider’s support pages or your control panel for clues about whether or not you’ll need to create one manually.\nIf you determine that you’ll need to create one manually, follow the instructions for Using phpMyAdmin below to create your WordPress username and database. For other tools such as Plesk, cPanel and Using the MySQL Client, refer the article Creating Database for WordPress.\nIf you have only one database and it is already in use, you can install WordPress in it – just make sure to have a distinctive prefix for your tables to avoid over-writing any existing database tables.\nUsing phpMyAdmin\nIf your web server has phpMyAdmin installed, you may follow these instructions to create your WordPress username and database. If you work on your own computer, on most Linux distributions you can install PhpMyAdmin automatically.\nNote: These instructions are written for phpMyAdmin 4.4; the phpMyAdmin user interface can vary slightly between versions.\n\nIf a database relating to WordPress does not already exist in the Database dropdown on the left, create one:\n\nChoose a name for your WordPress database: ‘wordpress‘ or ‘blog‘ are good, but most hosting services (especially shared hosting) will require a name beginning with your username and an underscore, so, even if you work on your own computer, we advise that you check your hosting service requirements so that you can follow them on your own server and be able to transfer your database without modification. Enter the chosen database name in the Create database field and choose the best collation for your language and encoding. In most cases it’s better to choose in the “utf8_” series and, if you don’t find your language, to choose “utf8mb4_general_ci” (Refer this article).\n\n\nClick the phpMyAdmin icon in the upper left to return to the main page, then click the Users tab. If a user relating to WordPress does not already exist in the list of users, create one:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick Add user.\nChoose a username for WordPress (‘wordpress‘ is good) and enter it in the User name field. (Be sure Use text field: is selected from the dropdown.)\nChoose a secure password (ideally containing a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols), and enter it in the Password field. (Be sure Use text field: is selected from the dropdown.) Re-enter the password in the Re-typefield.\nWrite down the username and password you chose.\nLeave all options under Global privileges at their defaults.\nClick Go.\n# Return to the Users screen and click the Edit privileges icon on the user you’ve just created for WordPress.\n# In the Database-specific privileges section, select the database you’ve just created for WordPress under the Add privileges to the following database dropdown, and click Go.\n# The page will refresh with privileges for that database. Click Check All to select all privileges, and click Go.\n# On the resulting page, make note of the host name listed after Server: at the top of the page. (This will usually be localhost.)\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Set up wp-config.php\nYou can either create and edit the wp-config.php file yourself, or you can skip this step and let WordPress try to do this itself when you run the installation script (step 5). (you’ll still need to tell WordPress your database information).\n(For more extensive details, and step by step instructions for creating the configuration file and your secret key for password security, please see Editing wp-config.php.)\nReturn to where you extracted the WordPress package in Step 1, rename the file wp-config-sample.php to wp-config.php, and open it in a text editor.\nEnter your database information under the section labeled\n // ** MySQL settings - You can get this info from your web host ** //\n\n\nDB_NAME \nThe name of the database you created for WordPress in Step 2.\nDB_USER \nThe username you created for WordPress in Step 2.\nDB_PASSWORD \nThe password you chose for the WordPress username in Step 2.\nDB_HOST \nThe hostname you determined in Step 2 (usually localhost, but not always; see some possible DB_HOST values). If a port, socket, or pipe is necessary, append a colon (:) and then the relevant information to the hostname.\nDB_CHARSET \nThe database character set, normally should not be changed (see Editing wp-config.php).\nDB_COLLATE \nThe database collation should normally be left blank (see Editing wp-config.php).\n\nEnter your secret key values under the section labeled\n  * Authentication Unique Keys and Salts.\n\nSave the wp-config.php file.\nStep 4: Upload the files\nNow you will need to decide where on your domain you’d like your WordPress-powered site to appear:\n\nIn the root directory of your website. (For example, http://example.com/)\nIn a subdirectory of your website. (For example, http://example.com/blog/)\n\nNote: The location of your root web directory in the filesystem on your web server will vary across hosting providers and operating systems. Check with your hosting provider or system administrator if you do not know where this is.\nIn the Root Directory\n\nIf you need to upload your files to your web server, use an FTP client to upload all the contents of the wordpress directory (but not the directory itself) into the root directory of your website.\nIf your files are already on your web server, and you are using shell access to install WordPress, move all of the contents of the wordpress directory (but not the directory itself) into the root directory of your website.\n\nIn a Subdirectory\n\nIf you need to upload your files to your web server, rename the wordpress directory to your desired name, then use an FTP client to upload the directory to your desired location within the root directory of your website.\nIf your files are already on your web server, and you are using shell access to install WordPress, move the wordpress directory to your desired location within the root directory of your website, and rename the directory to your desired name.\n\nStep 5: Run the Install Script\nPoint a web browser to start the installation script.\n\nIf you placed the WordPress files in the root directory, you should visit: http://example.com/wp-admin/install.php\nIf you placed the WordPress files in a subdirectory called blog, for example, you should visit: http://example.com/blog/wp-admin/install.php\n\nSetup configuration file\nIf WordPress can’t find the wp-config.php file, it will tell you and offer to try to create and edit the file itself. (You can also do this directly by loading wp-admin/setup-config.php in your web browser.) WordPress will ask you the database details and write them to a new wp-config.php file. If this works, you can go ahead with the installation; otherwise, go back and create, edit, and upload the wp-config.php file yourself (step 3).\nFinishing installation\nThe following screenshots show how the installation progresses. Notice that in entering the details screen, you enter your site title, your desired user name, your choice of a password (twice), and your e-mail address. Also displayed is a check-box asking if you would like your blog to appear in search engines like Google and DuckDuckGo. Leave the box unchecked if you would like your blog to be visible to everyone, including search engines, and check the box if you want to block search engines, but allow normal visitors. Note all this information can be changed later in your Administration Screen.\nIf you successfully install the WordPress, login prompt will be displayed.\nInstall script troubleshooting\n\nIf you get an error about the database when you run the install script:\n\nGo back to Step 2 and Step 3, and make sure you entered all the correct database information into wp-config.php.\nMake sure you granted your WordPress user permission to access your WordPress database in Step 3.\nMake sure the database server is running.\n\n\n\nCommon Installation Problems\nThe following are some of the most common installation problems. For more information and troubleshooting for problems with your WordPress installation, check out FAQ Installation and FAQ Troubleshooting.\nI see a directory listing rather than a web page.\nThe web server needs to be told to view index.php by default. In Apache, use the DirectoryIndex index.php directive. The simplest option is to create a file named .htaccess in the installed directory and place the directive there. Another option is to add the directive to the web server’s configuration files.\nI see lots of Headers already sent errors. How do I fix this?\nYou probably introduced a syntax error in editing wp-config.php.\n\nDownload wp-config.php (if you don’t have shell access).\nOpen it in a text editor.\nCheck that the first line contains nothing but <?php, and that there is no text before it (not even whitespace).\nCheck that the last line contains nothing but ?>, and that there is no text after it (not even whitespace).\nIf your text editor saves as Unicode, make sure it adds no byte order mark (BOM). Most Unicode-enabled text editors do not inform the user whether or not it adds a BOM to files; if so, try using a different text editor.\nSave the file, upload it again if necessary, and reload the page in your browser.\n\nMy page comes out gibberish. When I look at the source I see a lot of “<?php ?>” tags.\nIf the <?php ?> tags are being sent to the browser, it means your PHP is not working properly. All PHP code is supposed to be executed before the server sends the resulting HTML to your web browser. (That’s why it’s called a preprocessor.) Make sure your web server meets the requirements to run WordPress, that PHP is installed and configured properly, or contact your hosting provider or system administrator for assistance.\nI keep getting an Error connecting to database message but I’m sure my configuration is correct.\nTry resetting your MySQL password manually. If you have access to MySQL via shell, try issuing:\nSET PASSWORD FOR 'wordpressusername'@'hostname' = OLD_PASSWORD('password');\n\nIf you do not have shell access, you should be able to simply enter the above into an SQL query in phpMyAdmin. Failing that, you may need to use your host’s control panel to reset the password for your database user.\nI keep getting an Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress message but I’m sure my configuration is correct.\nCheck to make sure that your configuration of your web-server is correct and that the MySQL plugin is getting loaded correctly by your web-server program. Sometimes this issue requires everything in the path all the way from the web-server down to the MySQL installation to be checked and verified to be fully operational. Incorrect configuration files or settings are often the cause of this issue.\nMy image/MP3 uploads aren’t working.\nIf you use the Rich Text Editor on a blog that’s installed in a subdirectory, and drag a newly uploaded image into the editor field, the image may vanish a couple seconds later. This is due to a problem with TinyMCE (the rich text editor) not getting enough information during the drag operation to construct the path to the image or other file correctly. The solution is to NOT drag uploaded images into the editor. Instead, click and hold on the image and select Send to Editor.", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/how-to-install-wordpress/", "title": "How to install WordPress – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "WordPress is well-known for its ease of installation.

{"text": "\nAlso known as Two-Factor Authentication.\nTwo-step authentication is showing up all over the Internet as more sites look for better ways to secure logins, which are the weakest part of anything a user does online.\nWhat is Two-Step Authentication\nPasswords are the de-facto standard for logging in on the web, but they’re relatively easy to break. Even if you make good passwords and change them regularly, they need to be stored wherever you’re logging in, and a server breach can leak them. There are three ways to identify a person, things they are, things they have, and things they know.\nLogging in with a password is single-step authentication. It relies only on something you know. Two-step authentication, by definition, is a system where you use two of the three possible factors to prove your identity, instead of just one. In practice, however, current two-step implementations still rely on a password you know, but use your Phone or another device to authenticate with something you have.\nThree Possible Factors\nThere are three possible ways to identify users.\nSomething You Are\nThere are a lot of properties that are unique to each user and can be used to identify them. The most popular is fingerprints, but retinas, voice, DNA, or anything else specific to an individual will work. This is called biometric information because these pieces of information all belong to a person’s biology.\nBiometric factors are interesting because they are not easily forged and the user can never lose or forget them. However, biometric authentication is tricky because a lost fingerprint can never be replaced. If hackers were to gain access to a database of fingerprints, there is no way that users could reset them or get a new set.\nIn 2013, Apple released TouchID which lets users unlock their iPhones using their fingerprints. This technology is interesting because the fingerprints are stored locally on the phone, not in the cloud where they would be easier for hackers to steal. There are still trade-offs with this kind of approach, but it is the most widespread consumer use of biometric authentication to date.\nSomething You Have\nAlso known as the possession factor, users can be identified by the devices which they carry. Traditionally, a company that wanted to enable two-step authentication would distribute secure keychain fobs to users. The keychain fobs would display a new number every 30 seconds, and that number would be needed to be typed along with the password every time a user logged in.\nModern two-step authentication more frequently relies on a user’s smartphone than on a new piece of hardware. One common model of this uses SMS in order to provide an easy second factor. When the user enters their password, they are sent a text message with a unique code. By entering that code, after the password, they supposedly prove that they also have their phone. Unfortunately, SMS is not a secure communication channel, so smartphone apps and plugins have been developed to create that secure channel.\nSomething You Know\nThe most familiar form of authentication is the knowledge factor, or password. As old as Open Sesame, passwords have long been a standard for anonymous authentication. In order for a knowledge factor to work, both parties need to know the password, but other parties must not be able to find or guess it.\nThe first challenge is in exchanging the password with the trusted party safely. On the web, when you register for a new site, your password needs to be sent to that site’s servers and might be intercepted in the process (which is why you should always check for SSL when registering or logging in — Administration Over SSL).\nOnce the password has been received, it must be kept secret. The user shouldn’t write it down or use it anywhere else, and the site needs to carefully guard its database to ensure that hackers can’t access the passwords.\nFinally, the password needs to be verified. When a user visits the site, they need to be able to provide the password and have it verified against the stored copy. This exchange can also be intercepted (and so should always be done over SSL — Administration Over SSL) and exposes the user to another risk.\nBenefits\nThere are a lot of different places to increase the security of a site, but the WordPress Security Team has said that “The weakest link in the security of anything you do online is your password,” so it makes sense to put energy into strengthening that aspect of your site.\nDrawbacks\nAs the name implies, two-step authentication is adding a step to a process that can already be long and painful. While most very high-security logins are protected by two-step authentication today, most consumer applications barely offer it as an option if they offer it at all. This is because users are less likely to sign up for and log in to a service if it is more difficult.\nTwo-step authentication can also prevent legitimate logins. If a user forgets their phone at home and has two-step authentication enabled, then they won’t be able to access their account. This is one of the main reasons why smartphones have been useful for two-step authentication — users are more likely to be carrying their phones than almost anything else.\nPlugins for Two-Step Authentication\nYou can search for two-step authentication plugins available in the WordPress.org plugin repository.

{"text": "\nIt is strongly recommended that you backup your database at regular intervals and before an upgrade.\nRestoring your database from backup is then possible if something goes wrong. \nNOTE: Below steps backup core WordPress database that include all your posts, pages and comments, but DO NOT backup the files and folders such as images, theme files on the server. For whole WordPress site backup, refer WordPress Backups.\nBackup using cPanel X\ncPanel is a popular control panel used by many web hosts. The backup feature can be used to backup your MySQL database. Do not generate a full backup, as these are strictly for archival purposes and cannot be restored via cPanel. Look for ‘Download a MySQL Database Backup’ and click the name of the database. A *.gz file will be downloaded to your local drive.\nThere is no need to unzip this file to restore it. Using the same cPanel program, browse to the gz file and upload it. Once the upload is complete, the bottom of the browser will indicate dump complete. If you are uploading to a new host, you will need to recreate the database user along with the matching password. If you change the password, make the corresponding change in the wp-config.php file.\nUsing phpMyAdmin\nphpMyAdmin is the name of the program used to manipulate your database.\nInformation below has been tried and tested using phpMyAdmin version 4.4.13 connects to MySQL version 5.6.28 running on Linux.\n\nQuick backup process\nWhen you backup all tables in the WordPress database without compression, you can use simple method. To restore this backup, your new database should not have any tables.\nLog into phpMyAdmin on your serverFrom the left side window, select your WordPress database. In this example, the name of database is “wp”. The right side window will show you all the tables inside your WordPress database. Click the ‘Export’ tab on the top set of tabs.\n\n4. Ensure that the Quick option is selected, and click ‘Go’ and you should be prompted for a file to download. Save the file to your computer. Depending on the database size, this may take a few moments.\n\nCustom backup process\nIf you want to change default behavior, select Custom backup.  In above Step 4, select Custom option. Detailed options are displayed.\n\nThe Table section\nAll the tables in the database are selected. If you have other programs that use the database, then choose only those tables that correspond to your WordPress install. They will be the ones with that start with “wp_” or whatever ‘table_prefix’ you specified in your ‘wp-config.php’ file.\nIf you only have your WordPress blog installed, leave it as is (or click ‘Select All’ if you changed the selection)\nThe Output section\nSelect ‘zipped’ or ‘gzipped’ from Compression box to compress the data.\n\n\nThe Format section\nEnsure that the SQL is selected. Unlike CSV or other data formats, this option exports a sequence of SQL commands.\nIn the Format-specific options section, leave options as they are.\n\nThe Object creation options section\nSelect Add DROP TABLE / VIEW / PROCEDURE / FUNCTION / EVENT / TRIGGER statement. Before table creation on target database, it will call DROP statement to delete the old existing table if it exist.\n\nThe Data creation options section\nLeave options as they are.\n\nNow click ‘Go’ at the bottom of the window and you should be prompted for a file to download. Save the file to your computer. Depending on the database size, this may take a few moments.\nRemember – you have NOT backed up the files and folders – such as images – but all your posts and comments are now safe.\nUsing Straight MySQL/MariaDB Commands\nphpMyAdmin cannot handle large databases so using straight MySQL/MariaDB code will help.\nChange your directory to the directory you want to export backup to:\nuser@linux:~> cd files/blog\nuser@linux:~/files/blog>\nUse the mysqldump command with your MySQL server name, user name and database name. It prompts you to input password (For help, try: man mysqldump).\nTo backup all database tables\nmysqldump --add-drop-table -h mysql_hostserver -u mysql_username -p mysql_databasename﻿\nTo backup only certain tables from the database\nmysqldump --add-drop-table -h mysql_hostserver -u mysql_username -p mysql_databasename﻿\nExample:\nuser@linux:~/files/blog> mysqldump --add-drop-table -h db01.example.net -u dbocodex -p wp > blog.bak.sql\nEnter password: (type password)\nUse bzip2 to compress the backup file\nuser@linux:~/files/blog> bzip2 blog.bak.sql\nYou can do the same thing that above two commands do in one line:\nuser@linux:~/files/blog> mysqldump --add-drop-table -h db01.example.net -u dbocodex -p wp | bzip2 -c > blog.bak.sql.bz2\nEnter password: (type password)\nThe bzip2 -c after the | (pipe) means the backup is compressed on the fly, and the > blog.bak.sql.bz2 sends the bzip output to a file named blog.bak.sql.bz2.\nDespite bzip2 being able to compress most files more effectively than the older compression algorithms (.Z, .zip, .gz), it is considerably slower (compression and decompression).

As long as you have access to the MySQL databases on the remote server, you can backup your data to wherever you have write access.There is no limit to the size of the database to be backed up as there is with phpMyAdmin.\nInformation below has been tried and tested using MySQL Workbench version 6.3.6 connects to MySQL version 5.6.28 running on Linux.\n\nBacking Up the Database\nThis assumes you have already installed MySQL Workbench and set it up so that you can login to the MySQL Database Server either locally or remotely. Refer to the documentation that comes with the installation package of MySQL Workbench for your platform for installation instructions or online document.\nLaunch the MySQL WorkbenchClick your database instance if it is displayed on the top page. Or, Click Database -> Connect Database from top menu, enter required information and Click OK.Click Data Export in left side window.\n\nSelect your WordPress databases that you want to backup.Specify target directory on Export Options.

{"text": "\nOnce you’ve created a Multisite Network, there are some additional things you might need to know about advanced administration, due to the additional complexity of a Multisite. Even if you’re familiar with WordPress, the location and behavior of Multisite Network Administration can be confusing.\nUser Access & Capabilities\nBy design, all users who are added to your network will have subscriber access to all sites on your network. To allocate a different default role for users on individual sites, you must use a plugin.\nThe capabilities of the site administrator role are also reduced in a WordPress Network. Site admins cannot install new themes or plugins and cannot edit the profiles of users on their site. Only the Network Admin (aka Super Admin) has the ability to perform these tasks in a WordPress network.\nPermalinks in SubFolder Installs\nWhile permalinks will continue to work, the main site (i.e. the first one created) will have an extra entry of blog, making your URLs appear like domain.com/blog/YYYY/MM/POSTNAME.\nThis is by design, in order to prevent collisions with SubFolder installs. Currently there is no easy way to change it, as doing so prevents WordPress from auto-detecting collisions between your main site and any subsites. This will be addressed, and customizable, in a future version of WordPress.\nAlso note that the blog prefix is not used for static pages which will be accessible directly under the base address, e.g. domain.com/PAGENAME. If you try to create a static page in the first site with the name of another existing site on the network, the page’s permalink will get a suffix (e.g. domain.com/PAGENAME-2). If you create a new site with the slug of an existing static page, the static page will not be reachable anymore. To prevent this, you can add the names of your static pages to the blacklist so that no site with that name can be created.\nUploaded File Path\nYour first site on a fresh install will put uploaded files in the traditional location of /wp-content/uploads/, however all subsequent sites on your network will be in the /wp-content/uploads/sites/ folder, in their own subfolder based on the site number, designated by the database. These files will be accessible via that URL.\nThis is a change from Multisite 3.0-3.4.2, where images of subsites were stored in /wp-content/blogs.dir/ and were shown in http://example.com/files/ and http://example.com/sitename/files and so on. If you started with a Multisite install older than 3.5, it is not an error if your images show with the URL of /files/.\nRegardless of WP version, these locations cannot be changed by site admins. Only the network admin can make changes on the site settings page. It is not recommended that you change these without understanding how both the ms-files.php works in conjunction with your .htaccess, as it can easily become non-functional. If the /files/ urls aren’t working, it’s indicative of a misconfigured .htaccess or httpd.conf file on your server.\nPlugins\nPlugins now have additional flexibility, depending upon their implementation across the network. All plugins are installed on the network dashboard’s plugin page, and can be activated either per-site or for the entire network.\nSite Specific Plugins: These plugins are activated from within the plugins page of a single specific site. Some plugins (contact forms, for example) work best when they are single-site activated, so that they can store data and settings in that single site’s database tables, instead of the tables for the whole network. WordPress Plugins to be single-site activated/deactivated are stored in the plugins directory.Network Plugins: Network admins may ‘network activate’ plugins in the Network Admin dashboard for plugins. Once ‘network activated’, plugins will become active in all sites. ‘Network Activated’ plugins are indicated as “Network Active” in plugin lists in the dashboards of individual sites. Some plugins only function in a multisite environment when they are network activated. WordPress Plugins that are Network Activated are also stored in the plugins directory.Must-Use Plugins: Plugins to be used by all sites on the entire network may also be installed in the mu-plugins directory as single files, or a file to include a subfolder. Any files within a folder will not be read. These files are not activated or deactivated; if they exist, they are used. These plugins are hidden entirely from per-site plugin lists.\nNot all plugins in the repository will work in a multisite environment. Consult the plugin’s repository page or contact the developer for information about whether a specific plugin will function in a multisite network.\nIf you would like single site administrators to be able to activate/deactivate site-specific plugins for their site, you need to enable the Plugins page for single site administrators from the Network Admin’s Settings -> Network Settings menu (“Menu Settings”). Network Admins will always have access to the plugins of every site. Administrators of a single site will be able to activate and deactivate plugins that are not Network Activated, but will see the Network Activated plugins as “Network Active” with no options for deactivation or settings.\nThere are plugins that will assist with mass activating/deactivating plugins for single sites.\nThemes\nAll themes are installed for the entire network. If you edit the code of one theme, you edit it for all sites using that theme. You can install the plugin WP Add Custom CSS to allow each site to tweak their own CSS without affecting anyone else. Also, individual sites may use the Theme Customizer, and their settings will be stored only in the tables for their site.\n“Network Activating” a theme does not make it the active theme on each site, but merely makes it available to be activated on all individual sites.  To be available for activation in the dashboard of a single site, a theme must be either network activated or enabled in Network Admin – Edit Site – Themes tab. After a theme has been activated in a single site, it may be network deactivated without affecting the single site where it remains activated.\nBy default, WordPress assigns the most recent “Twenty …” as the theme for all new sites. This can be customized by adding a line like define('WP_DEFAULT_THEME', 'classic'); to your wp-config.php file, where ‘classic’ is replaced with the folder name of your theme.\nCategories and Tags\nGlobal terms (i.e. sharing tags and categories between sites on the network) is not available in WordPress 3.0. You can use plugin to incorporate global tags on the portal/front page of the site or on specific pages or sites within the network to increase navigation based upon micro-categorized content.\nContent Sharing Between Sites\nThe sites of a network are separate sites that don’t by default share content. Think of your network as a mini version of WordPress.com. There are several plugins which may help you share content between your sites, like this one.\nSwitching network types\nIt’s possible to switch between domain-based (sub-domain) and path-based (sub-directory) installations of Multisite. If you have had WordPress installed for longer than a month on a single site, and are attempting to activate that site into a network, you will be told to use Sub-domain sites. This is in order to ensure you don’t have conflicts between pages (i.e. example.com/pagename ) and sites (i.e. example.com/sitename ). If you are confident you will not have this issue, then you can change this after you finish the initial setup.\nIn your wp-config.php file, you’ll want to change the define call for SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL:\n\n     For a domain-based network (sub-domain install)\n\n\ndefine( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', true );\n\n\n     For a path-based network (sub-directory install)\n\n\ndefine( 'SUBDOMAIN_INSTALL', false );\nYou’ll also have to change your .htaccess to the new setup. You can go to Network Admin — Settings — Network Setup to find the new .htaccess rules, or see below.\nNote that per the Settings Requirements you cannot switch from Sub-directory to Sub-domain when running on 127.0.0.1 or localhost. This can potentially cause an endless loop of reauth=1 on your root site due to cookie handling.\nApache Virtual Hosts and Mod Rewrite\nTo enable mod_rewrite to work within an Apache Virtual host you may need to set some options on the DocumentRoot.\n<VirtualHost *:80>\n  DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/wordpress\n  <Directory /var/www/vhosts/wordpress>\n    AllowOverride Fileinfo Options\n  </Directory>\n\n\nIn some instances, you will need to add All to your AllowOverride for all htaccess rules to be honored.\n.htaccess and Mod Rewrite\nUnlike Single Site WordPress, which can work with “ugly” Permalinks and thus does not need Mod Rewrite, MultiSite requires its use to format URLs for your subsites. This necessitates the use of an .htaccess file, the format of which will be slightly different if you’re using SubFolders or SubDomains. The examples below are the standard .htaccess entries for WordPress SubFolders and SubDomains, when WordPress is installed in the root folder of your website. If you have WordPress in its own folder, you will need to change the value for RewriteBase appropriately.\nAs a reminder, these are EXAMPLES and work in most, but not all, installs.\nSubFolder Example\nWordPress 3.0 through 3.4+\n# BEGIN WordPress\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L]\n\n# uploaded files\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?files/(.+) wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$2 [L]\n\n# add a trailing slash to /wp-admin\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?wp-admin$ $1wp-admin/ [R=301,L]\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\nRewriteRule ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(wp-(content|admin|includes).*) $1 [L]\nRewriteRule ^[_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/(.*\\.php)$ $1 [L]\nRewriteRule . index.php [L]\n# END WordPress\nWordPress 3.5+ ONLY use this if you STARTED Multisite on 3.5. If you upgraded from 3.4 to 3.5, use the old one!\n# BEGIN WordPress\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L]\n\n# add a trailing slash to /wp-admin\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?wp-admin$ $1wp-admin/ [R=301,L]\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?(wp-(content|admin|includes).*) $2 [L]\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?(.*\\.php)$ $2 [L]\nRewriteRule . index.php [L]\n# END WordPress\nSubDomain Example\nWordPress 3.0 through 3.4+\n# BEGIN WordPress\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L]\n\n# uploaded files\nRewriteRule ^files/(.+) wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$1 [L]\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\nRewriteRule . index.php [L]\n# END WordPress\nWordPress 3.5+\n# BEGIN WordPress\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteBase /\nRewriteRule ^index.php$ - [L]\n\n# add a trailing slash to /wp-admin\nRewriteRule ^wp-admin$ wp-admin/ [R=301,L]\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d\nRewriteRule ^ - [L]\nRewriteRule ^(wp-(content|admin|includes).*) $1 [L]\nRewriteRule ^(.*\\.php)$ wp/$1 [L]\nRewriteRule . index.php [L]\n# END WordPress\nIssues with old WPMU installs\nIf you installed WordPress MU in subfolder/subdirectory (not in root folder on your server via ftp) and you have problem with image library, where thumbnails and images do not show, you may need to manually add in rewrite rules for your file directories as follows:\nRewriteRule ^([_0-9a-zA-Z-]+/)?siteN/files/(.+) wp-content/blogs.dir/N/files/$2 [L]\nPut those below the normal call for uploaded files.\nNetwork Admin Link Location\nThe Network Admin Link has moved with each major release of WordPress, as this is still a work in progress. Depending on which version of WordPress you are using, the link can be found in the following locations:\n3.0 – A menu called Super Admin3.1 – On the admin header by “Howdy, YOURNAME.”3.2 – On the admin header, as a drop-down under “Howdy, YOURNAME.”3.3+ – On the admin bar, as a drop-down under your “My Sites”\nDomain Mapping\nBefore WordPress 4.5, domain mapping requires a domain mapping plugin. In WordPress 4.5+, domain mapping is a native feature in Multisites. Learn how to use this feature  at WordPress Multisite Domain Mapping\nMoving Multisite\nMoving Multisite is more complicated than moving a single install. Please read Moving WordPress Multisite before continuing.\nImporting into a Network\nWhen you’ve created your WordPress Network for importing other sites, you need to look at the Migrating Multiple Blogs into WordPress Multisite article.\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/multisite-network-administration/", "title": "Multisite Network Administration – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Once you've created a Multisite Network, there are some additional things you might need to know about advanced administration, due to the additional complexity of a Multisite.

{"text": "\nMany people want WordPress to power their website’s root (e.g. http://example.com) but they don’t want all of the WordPress files cluttering up their root directory.  WordPress allows you to install it into a subdirectory, but have your website served from the website root.\nAs of Version 3.5, Multisite users may use all of the functionality listed below. If you are running a version of WordPress older than 3.5, please update before installing a Multisite WordPress install on a subdirectory.\nNote to theme/plugin developers: this will not separate your code from  WordPress. Themes and plugins will still reside under wp-content folder.\nMoving a Root install to its own directory\nLet’s say you’ve installed wordpress at example.com. Now you have two different methods to move wordpress installations into subdirectory:\n1) Without change of SITE-URL (remains example.com) \n2) With change in SITE-URL (it will redirect to example.com/subdirectory)\nMethod I (Without URL change)\n1) After Installing the wordpress in root folder, move EVERYTHING from root folder into subdirectory.\n2)  Create a .htaccess file in root folder, and put this content inside (just change example.com and my_subdir):\n<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?example.com$\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/my_subdir/\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ /my_subdir/$1\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?example.com$\nRewriteRule ^(/)?$ my_subdir/index.php [L]\n</IfModule>\n\nThat’s all 🙂\nMethod II (With URL change)\nMoving process\n(p.s. If you’ve already installed WP in subdirectory, some steps might be already done automatically).\nCreate the new location for the core WordPress files to be stored (we will use /wordpress in our examples). (On linux, use mkdir wordpress from your www directory. You’ll probably want to use chown apache:apache on the wordpress directory you created.)Go to the General Screen.In WordPress address (URL): set the address of your main WordPress core files. Example: http://example.com/wordpressIn Site address (URL): set root directory’s URL. Example: http://example.comClick Save Changes. (Do not worry about the errors that happen now! Continue reading)Now move your WordPress core files (from root directory) to the subdirectory.Copy (NOT MOVE!) the index.php and .htaccess files from the WordPress directory into the root directory of your site (Blog address). The .htaccess file is invisible, so you may have to set your FTP client to show hidden files. If you are not using pretty permalinks, then you may not have a .htaccess file. If you are running WordPress on a Windows (IIS) server and are using pretty permalinks, you’ll have a web.config rather than a .htaccess file in your WordPress directory. For the index.php file the instructions remain the same, copy (don’t move) the index.php file to your root directory. The web.config file, must be treated differently than the .htaccess file so you must MOVE (DON’T COPY) the web.config file to your root directory.Open your root directory’s index.php file in a text editorChange the following and save the file. Change the line that says:require dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wp-blog-header.php';to the following, using your directory name for the WordPress core files: require dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/wordpress/wp-blog-header.php';Login to the new location. It might now be http://example.com/wordpress/wp-admin/If you have set up Permalinks, go to the Permalinks Screen and update your Permalink structure. WordPress will automatically update your .htaccess file if it has the appropriate file permissions. If WordPress can’t write to your .htaccess file, it will display the new rewrite rules to you, which you should manually copy into your .htaccess file (in the same directory as the main index.php file.)\n.htaccess modification\nIn some cases, some people like to install separate versions in a subdirectory (such as /2010, /2011, /latest and etc..), and want that website (by default) used the latest version, then Install WordPress in a subdirectory, such as /my_subdir and in your root folder’s  .htaccess file add the following  (just change the words as you need):\nRewriteEngine On\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www.)?example.com$\nRewriteRule ^(/)?$ my_subdir[L]\n\nNow when users to go your root domain (example.com), it will automatically redirect to the subdirectory you specified.\nNote: This code comes from Site 5’s post here: How to Redirect Your Domain to a Subfolder Using .htaccess.\nMoving Specific WordPress Folders\nThe following links explains how to change specific directories within WordPress:\nMoving wp-content folderMoving Plugin FolderMoving Themes FolderMoving Uploads Folder\nSee also\nUsing Caddy to give WordPress its own directory\n", "info": {"url": "https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/giving-wordpress-its-own-directory/", "title": "Giving WordPress Its Own Directory – WordPress.org Documentation", "description": "Many people want WordPress to power their website's root (e.g. http://example.com) but they don't want all of the WordPress files cluttering up their root directory.
